<h3>THE SOURCES AND ANALOGUES</h3>
<p class="center">OF</p>
<h3>"A MIDSUMMER-NIGHT'S DREAM"</h3>

  <p>A study such as the present one does not demand any elaborate
  investigation of the date or circumstances of the first production of the
  play, unless these throw light on the inquiry into its sources; but in
  any case it is always well to base a literary study on literary history.
  Here it will suffice to say shortly that <i>A Midsummer-Night's
  Dream</i>, first published in 1600, must have been acted before or during
  1598, as it is definitely mentioned in Mores' <i>Palladic Tamia</i> of
  that year. A more exact determination of its date can only be derived
  from the internal evidence supplied by allusions in the text or by
  metrical and general style. Such allusions as have been
  discovered&mdash;for example, that reference to "the death of learning,"
  V. i. 52-3&mdash;form here as elsewhere a battle-ground for critics of
  all sorts, but do not really assist us to an answer. More trustworthy
  testimony, however, is afforded by the general character of the play, and
  by Shakespeare's handling of his material; these considerations, <!--
  Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2"></a>[2]</span> combined
  with whatever other evidence is available, have caused the play to be
  assigned to the winter of 1594-5. So placed, it is the latest of the
  early comedies of Shakespeare, who makes an advance on <i>The Two
  Gentlemen of Verona,</i> but has not yet attained the firmness of hand
  which fills the canvas of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> with so many
  well-delineated figures. Once arrived at this conclusion, we need not let
  ourselves again be led away into vagueness or critical polemics by an
  attempt to find any aristocratic wedding which this masque-like play
  seems designed to celebrate; such theorising, however interesting in
  other ways, does not concern and will not avail us now.</p>

  <p>It is none the less of value to recognise at the outset that <i>A
  Midsummer-Night's Dream</i> is more of a masque than a drama&mdash;an
  entertainment rather than a play. The characters are mostly puppets, and
  scarcely any except Bottom has the least psychological interest for the
  reader. Probability is thrown to the winds; anachronism is rampant;
  classical figures are mixed with fairies and sixteenth-century
  Warwickshire peasants. The main plot is sentimental, the secondary plot
  is sheer buffoonery; while the story; of Titania's jealousy and Oberon's
  method of curing it can scarcely be dignified by the title of plot at
  all. The threads which bind together these three tales, however
  ingeniously fastened, are fragile. The Spirit of Mischief puts a happy
  end to the differences of the four lovers, and by his transformation of
  Bottom reconciles the fairy King and Queen, while he <!-- Page 3 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3"></a>[3]</span> incidentally goes near to
  spoiling the performance of the "crew of patches" at the nuptials of
  Theseus by preventing due rehearsal of their interlude. It is perhaps a
  permissible fancy to convert Theseus' words "the lunatic, the lover, and
  the poet," to illustrate the triple appeal made by the three ingredients
  the grotesque, the sentimental, and the fantastic. Each part, of course,
  is coloured by the poet's genius, and the whole is devoted to the comic
  aspect of love, its eternal youth and endless caprice, laughing at laws,
  and laughed at by the secure. "What fools these mortals be!" is the
  comment of the immortal; the corollary, left unspoken by those outside
  the pale, being "What fools these lovers be!"</p>

  <p>The sources from which Shakespeare drew the plots of his three dozen
  of plays are for the most part easily recognisable; and although in each
  case the material was altered to suit his requirements&mdash;<i>nihil
  tetigit quod non ornavit</i>&mdash;there is as a rule very little doubt
  as to the derivation. We can say with certainty that these nine plays
  were made out of stories from Boccaccio, Masuccio, Bandello, Ser
  Giovanni, Straparola, Cinthio or Belleforest; that those six were based
  on older plays, and another half-dozen drawn from Holinshed; that
  Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate, Sidney, Greene, and Lodge provided other plots;
  and so forth, until we are left with <i>The Tempest</i>, founded in part
  on an actual contemporary event, <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>, apparently
  his only original plot&mdash;if indeed it deserve the name&mdash;and
  finally our present subject <i>A Midsummer-Nights Dream</i>.</p>

<!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
The problem&mdash;given the play&mdash;is to discover what parts
of it Shakespeare conveyed from elsewhere, and to investigate
those sources as far as is compatible with the limits
of this book. For this purpose, it is most convenient to
adopt the above-mentioned division into three component
plots or tales; and because these are rather loosely woven
together, the characters in the play may be simultaneously
divided thus:&mdash;

<td class="m  " width="53%">
  <p>The fairy plot.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>

  <p>It may be observed that for these three plots Shakespeare draws
  respectively on literature, observation, and oral tradition; for we shall
  see, I think, that while there can be little doubt that he had been
  reading Chaucer, North's Plutarch and Golding's Ovid, not to mention
  other works, probably including some which are now lost, it is also
  impossible to avoid the conclusion that much if not all of his fairy-lore
  is derived from no literary source at all, but from the popular beliefs
  which must have been current in oral tradition in his youth.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

  <p>As the play opens with speeches of Theseus and Hippolyta, it is
  convenient to treat first of these two characters. Mr. E.K. Chambers has
  collected (in Appendix D to his edition) nine passages from North's
  Plutarch's <i>Life of Theseus</i>, of which Shakespeare appears to have
  made direct use. For example, Oberon's references to "Perigenia,"
  "Aegles," "Ariadne and Antiopa" (II. i. 79-80) are doubtless derived from
  North; and certainly the reference by Theseus to his "kinsman Hercules"
  (V. i. 47) is based on the following passage:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>... "they were near kinsmen, being cousins removed by the mother's
  side. For Aethra was the daughter of Pittheus, and Alcmena (the mother of
  Hercules) was the daughter of Lysidice, the which was half-sister to
  Pittheus, both children of Pelops and of his wife Hippodamia."</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>In modern phraseology, Theseus and Hercules were thus second
  cousins.</p>

  <p>Of the Amazon queen North says:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>"Touching the voyage he [Theseus] made by the sea Maior, Philochorus,
  and some other hold opinion, <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_10"></a>[10]</span> that he went thither with Hercules against
  the Amazons, and that to honour his valiantness, Hercules gave him
  Antiopa the Amazon. But the more part of the other Historiographers ...
  do write, that Theseus went thither alone, after Hercules' voyage, and
  that he took this Amazon prisoner, which is likeliest to be true."</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>At this point we should interpolate the reason why Hercules went
  against the Amazons. The ninth (as usually enumerated) of the twelve
  labours of Hercules was to fetch away the girdle of the queen of the
  Amazons, a gift from her father Ares, the god of fighting. Admete, the
  daughter of Eurystheus (at whose bidding the twelve labours were
  performed) desired this girdle, and Hercules was sent by her father to
  carry it off by force. The queen of the Amazons was Hippolyta, and she
  had a sister named Antiopa. One story says that Hercules slew Hippolyta;
  another that Hippolyta was enticed on board his ship by Theseus; a third,
  as we have seen, that Theseus married Antiopa. It is not easy to choose
  incidents from these conflicting accounts so as to make a reasonable
  sequence; but, as North says, "we are not to marvel, if the history of
  things so ancient, be found so diversely written." Shakespeare simply
  states that Theseus "woo'd" Hippolyta "with his sword." Later in the play
  we learn that the fairy King and Queen not only are acquainted with
  court-scandal, but are each involved with the past histories of Theseus
  and Hippolyta (II. i. 70-80).</p>

  <p>Apart from these incidents in Theseus' life, Chaucer <!-- Page 11
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11"></a>[11]</span> supplies the
  dramatist with all he requires in the opening of <i>The Knightes
  Tale</i>, which we shall discuss in full shortly.<a name="Int_1"></a><a

    </div>
  </div>
<!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>

  <p>Egeus, whom Shakespeare makes a courtier of Theseus and father to
  Hermia, is in the classical legend Aegeus, father of Theseus; both
  Plutarch and Chaucer so mention him.</p>

  <p>The name of Philostrate also comes from Chaucer, where, as we shall
  see, it is the name adopted by Arcite when he returns to court in
  disguise, to become first "page of the chamber" to Emelye, and thereafter
  chief squire to Theseus. It is in this latter capacity that Chaucer's
  "Philostrate" is nearest to Shakespeare's character, the Master of the
  Revels.</p>

  <p>Of the four lovers, the names of Lysander, Demetrius, and Helena, are
  of course classical; Shakespeare would find lives of Lysander and
  Demetrius in North's Plutarch. The name of Hermia, who corresponds with
  Emilia or Emily of <i>The Knightes Tale</i>, as being the lady on whom
  the affections of the two young men are set, may have been taken from the
  legend of Aristotle and Hermia, referred to more than once by Greene. The
  name cannot be called classical, and appears to be a mistranslation of
  Hermias.<a name="Int_7"></a><a href="#IntN_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The story of Palamon and Arcite has not been traced beyond Boccaccio,
  that fountain of romance, though he himself says the tale of "Palemone
  and Arcita" is "una antichissima storia." Possibly the story was taken,
  as much of Boccaccio's writing must have been taken, from tradition. <!--
  Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
  Palaemon is a classical name,<a name="Int_8"></a><a
  href="#IntN_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> and Arcite might be a corruption of
  Archytas. Boccaccio's <i>Teseide</i> (the story of Theseus) which was
  written about 1344, and may have been first issued wholly or in part
  under the title of <i>Amazonide</i>, is a poem in the vernacular
  consisting of twelve books and ten thousand lines in <i>ottava
  rima</i>.<a name="Int_9"></a><a href="#IntN_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Chaucer, in the Prologue to <i>The Legend of Good Women</i> (which is
  presumably earlier than the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>) states that he had
  already written</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Skeat says "some scraps are preserved in other poems" of Chaucer; he
  instances (i) ten stanzas from this <i>Palamon and Arcite</i> in a minor
  poem <i>Anelida and Arcite</i>, where Chaucer refers to Statius,
  <i>Thebais</i>, xii. 519;<a name="Int_11"></a><a
  href="#IntN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> (ii) three <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14"></a>[14]</span> stanzas in <i>Trolius
  and Crheyde</i>; and (iii) six stanzas in <i>The Parlement of Foules</i>,
  where the description of the Temple of Love is borrowed almost word for
  word from Boccaccio's <i>Teseide</i>.<a name="Int_12"></a><a
  href="#IntN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Finally, Chaucer used <i>Palamon and
  Arcite</i> as the basis of <i>The Knightes Tale</i>. By this time, while
  he retains what folk-lorists call the "story-radical," he has reduced
  Boccaccio's epic to less than a quarter of its length, and improved it in
  details. It stands as the first of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>.</p>

<p class="center">ANALYSTS OF CHAUCER'S <i>KNIGHTES TALE</i></p>

  <p>Old stories relate that once there was a Duke Theseus, lord of Athens,
  a conqueror of many lands. His latest conquest was "Femenye" (once called
  Scythia), whose queen Hippolyta he wedded and brought home, accompanied
  by her young sister Emilia. Now as he drew near to Athens, a company of
  ladies met him in the way, and laid before him their complaint, to the
  effect that, their husbands having fallen at the siege of Thebes, Creon
  the tyrant of Thebes would not let the bodies be buried or burned, but
  cast them on a heap and suffered the dogs to eat them. <!-- Page 15
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15"></a>[15]</span> Duke Theseus,
  having sworn to avenge this wrong, sent Hippolyta and Emilia to Athens,
  and rode to Thebes, where in full battle he fought and slew Creon, and
  razed the city. The due obsequies were then performed.<a
  name="Int_13"></a><a href="#IntN_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Amongst the slain were found, half-dead, two young knights named
  Palamon and Arcite, whom the heralds recognised, from the cognisances on
  their armour, as of blood-royal, and born of two sisters. Theseus sent
  them to Athens to be held to ransom in prison perpetually, and himself
  returned home in triumph.</p>

  <p>So years and days passed, and Palamon and Arcite dwelt in durance in a
  tower; till on a morrow of May it befel that the fair and fresh Emilia
  arose to do observance to May, and walked in the garden, gathering
  flowers and singing. Now in a high chamber of the tower, which adjoined
  the garden-wall, Palamon by leave of his gaoler was pacing to and fro and
  bewailing his lot, when he cast his eyes through the thick-barred window,
  and beheld Emilia in the garden below; whereat he blenched, and cried out
  as though struck to the heart. Arcite heard him, and, asking him why he
  so cried out, bade him suffer imprisonment in patience; but Palamon
  replied that the cause of his crying out was the beauty of the lady in
  the <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_16"></a>[16]</span> garden. Thereupon Arcite spied out of the
  window at Emilia, and was so struck by her fairness</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"That if that Palamon was wounded sore,</p>
      <p>Arcite is hurt as muche as he, or more."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>So strife began between the two. Palamon said it were small honour for
  Arcite to be false to his cousin and sworn brother, since each had taken
  an oath not to hinder the other in love; nay, as a knight Arcite was
  bound to help him in his amour. But Arcite replied that love knows no
  law; decrees of man are every day broken for love; moreover Palamon and
  he were prisoners, and were like two dogs fighting for a bone which
  meantime a kite bears away. Let each continue in his love, for in prison
  each must endure.</p>

  <p>Now a duke name Pirithous came to visit his friend Theseus; who being
  also a friend to Arcite begged Theseus to let him go free out of prison,
  which Theseus did. And Arcite was set free without ransom, but on
  condition that his life should be forfeit if he ever set foot again in
  any domain of Duke Theseus.</p>

  <p>Yet now Arcite found himself in no better stead, being banished from
  the sight of his lady; and could even find it in his heart to envy
  Palamon, who might still blissfully abide in prison&mdash;nay, not in
  prison, in Paradise, where sometimes he might see her whom both loved.
  And on his part Palamon was jealous of Arcite, who might even now be <!--
  Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
  calling together his kin in Thebes to make onslaught on Athens and win
  his lady Emilia.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Yow loveres axe I now this questioun,</p>
      <p>Who hath the worse, Arcite or Palamoun?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now when Arcite had for a year or two endured this torment, he dreamed
  one night that the god Mercury appeared to him, and said to him, "To
  Athens shalt thou wend." Whereupon Arcite started up, and saw in the
  mirror that his sufferings had so changed him that he might live in
  Athens unknown. So he clad himself as a labourer, and went with one
  squire to Athens, and offered his service at the court, where for a year
  or two he was page of the chamber to Emilia, and passed under the name of
  Philostrate. And in the course of time he was so honoured that Theseus
  took notice of him, and made him squire of his own chamber, and
  maintained him nobly.</p>

  <p>Meantime Palamon had lain seven years in prison, when it befel on the
  third day of May (as the old books that tell this story say) that, aided
  by a friend, he broke prison, having given his gaoler to drink of drugged
  wine, and so fled the city, and lay hid in a grove. Hither by chance came
  Arcite to do observance to May; and first Palamon heard him sing</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Wel-come be thou, faire fresshe May;</p>
      <p>I hope that I som grene gete may,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and thereafter fall into a study, as lovers will, lamenting his hard
  fate that he should be passing under a false name, and <!-- Page 18
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18"></a>[18]</span> daily be slain
  by the eyes of Emilia. Whereat Palamon started up, and reproached him,
  and challenged him to fight; and Arcite answered him no less boldly,
  saying he would bring him arms and weapons on the morrow, as well as meat
  and drink and bedding for the night.</p>

  <p>So on the morrow the two donned their harness, helping each other to
  arm, and then fell a-fighting, Palamon like a wild lion, and Arcite like
  a cruel tiger, till they were ankle-deep in blood.</p>

  <p>On the same day rode forth Theseus with Hippolyta and Emilia to hunt
  the hart, and Theseus was aware of the two knights fighting. He spurred
  his steed between them, and cried to them to hold their hands. And
  Palamon told him who they were, and why they fought. Theseus at first was
  angry, and condemned them both to death; but when the queen Hippolyta and
  Emilia and the ladies of their train pleaded for them, he relented,
  bethinking himself of what love is, for he himself had been a servant
  [lover] in his time; wherefore, at the request of the queen and Emilia,
  he forgave them, if they would swear to do his country no harm, and be
  his friends. And when they had sworn, he reasoned with them, that each
  was worthy to wed Emilia, but that both could not so do; therefore let
  each depart for a year, and gather to him a hundred knights, and then
  return to tourney in the lists for the hand of Emilia.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Who loketh lightly now but Palamoun?</p>
      <p>Who springeth up for joye but Arcite?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
And thanking him on their knees, they took their leave and
rode away.

  <p>Royal were the lists which Theseus made, a mile in circuit, and walled
  with stone. Eastward and westward were marble gates, whereon were built
  temples of Venus and Mars, while in a turret on the north wall was a
  shrine of Diana goddess of chastity. And each temple was nobly carven and
  wrought with statues and pictures.</p>

  <p>Now the day of the tourney approached, and Palamon and Arcite returned
  each with a hundred knights.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"To fighte for a lady, <i>ben'cite!</i></p>
      <p>It were a lusty sighte for to see."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Palamon brought with him Ligurge king of Thrace, and with Arcite was
  Emetreas, the king of India, each a giant in might. So on a Sunday they
  all came to the city.</p>

  <p>And in the night, ere dawn, Palamon arose and went to the temple of
  Venus to pray that he might win Emilia for his wife; and, as it seemed,
  in answer to his prayer, the statue of Venus shook, and Palamon held it
  for a sign that the boon he asked was granted. Emilia meanwhile went to
  the temple of Diana, and prayed to the goddess, that she might remain a
  virgin, and that the hearts of Palamon and Arcite might be turned from
  her; or, if she needs must wed one of the twain, let him be the one that
  most desired her. To her appeared the goddess Diana, and told her that
  she must be <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_20"></a>[20]</span> wedded to one of the two, but she might
  not tell which that one should be.</p>

  <p>And Arcite went to the temple of Mars, and prayed for victory; whereat
  the door of the temple clattered, and the fires blazed up on the altar,
  while the hauberk on the god's statue rang, and Arcite heard a murmur of
  "Victory." So rejoicing thereat he returned home</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"As fayn as fowel is of the brighte sonne."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Thereafter in the heavens above strife began betwixt Mars and Venus,
  such that Jupiter himself was troubled to quell it; till Saturn (the
  father of Venus) comforted his daughter with assurance that Palamon
  should win his lady.</p>

  <p>That day was high festival in Athens, and all Monday they justed and
  feasted, but went betimes to rest that they might rise early to see the
  great fight. And on the morrow there were lords and knights and squires,
  armourers, yeomen and commoners, and steeds and palfreys, on every hand,
  and all was ready.</p>

  <p>Now a herald proclaimed from a scaffold the will of Duke Theseus,
  decreeing the weapons with which the tourney should be fought, and the
  rules of the combat. Then with trumpets and music, Theseus and Hippolyta
  and Emilia in a noble procession took their places; and from the west
  gate under the temple of Mars came Arcite with a red banner, and from the
  east, under the temple of Venus, Palamon with a white banner. And the
  names of the two companies were <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_21"></a>[21]</span> recited, the heralds left pricking up and
  down, the trumpet and clarion sounded, and the just began. Sore was the
  fight, and many were wounded and by the duke's proclamation removed from
  the fight; and many a time fought Palamon and Arcite together. But
  everything must have an end; Emetreus gave Palamon a wound; and though
  Ligurge attempted his rescue, he was borne down; and though Emetreus was
  thrust from his saddle by Palamon, Palamon was wounded, and had to give
  up the combat and the hope of winning Emilia. And Theseus cried to them
  that the tourney was finished, and that Arcite should have the lady;
  whereat the rejoicing of the people was loud.</p>

  <p>But in heaven Venus wept, so that her tears fell down into the lists;
  yet Saturn promised that her sorrow should be eased soon.</p>

  <p>And in truth as Arcite rode in triumph down the lists, looking up at
  Emilia, Pluto, at the bidding of Saturn, sent from hell a fury, that
  started from the ground in front of Arcite's horse, which shied and threw
  his rider; and Arcite pitched on his head, and lay as though dead. They
  bore him to Theseus' palace, cut his harness from off him, and laid him
  in a bed.</p>

  <p>Theseus for three days entertained the knights of the tourney, and
  then all of them went their several ways. But Arcite lay dying; no longer
  had Nature any power;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"And certeinly, ther nature wol nat wirche,</p>
      <p>Far-wel, phisyk! go ber the man to chirche!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
On his deathbed he called Palamon and Emilia to his side,
and bade farewell to his heart's queen, commending Palamon
to her,

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"As in this world right now ne knowe I non</p>

      <p>And if that ever ye shul ben a wyf,</p>
      <p>Forget nat Palamon, the gentil man."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And his speech failed him, and his strength went out of him: but he
  still kept his eyes fixed on his lady, and his last word was "Mercy,
  Emilye!"</p>

  <p>Theseus gave Arcite a costly funeral, and built his funeral pyre in
  the grove where Palamon had heard him lament on the morning of May. And
  when by process of time the grief and mourning for Arcite had ceased,
  Theseus sent for Palamon and Emilia; and with wise words bidding them be
  merry after woe, gave Emilia to Palamon, who wedded her, and they lived
  in bliss and in richness and in health.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Thus endeth Palamon and Emelye.</p>
      <p>And God save all this faire companye!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Such is Chaucer's tale of Palamon and Arcite. It was dramatised before
  Shakespeare's day by Richard Edwardes in a play now lost. Possibly the
  play of "Palamon and Arcite" four times recorded&mdash;in for different
  spellings&mdash;by Henslowe in his <i>Diary</i><a name="Int_14"></a><a
  href="#IntN_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> is Edwardes' play, but as the <!--
  Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23"></a>[23]</span> latter
  was performed at Oxford before Queen Elizabeth as early as 1566, it is at
  least equally possible that Henslowe's play is another version.</p>

  <p>The complete Chaucerian form of the story of Palamon and Arcite is
  dramatised in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, a play to which Shakespeare
  undoubtedly<a name="Int_15"></a><a href="#IntN_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
  contributed. The changes made by the authors&mdash;Fletcher and Massinger
  or Shakespeare, or all three&mdash;are little more than such limitations
  as are demanded by dramatic form; for instance, the Kinsmen, when
  discovered fighting, are dismissed for a month to find three knights,
  instead of being given a year to find one hundred. Chaucer's hint, that
  Palamon was assisted to escape from prison by a friend, is developed by
  the dramatists to make the sub-plot of the gaoler's daughter. The
  character-drawing is far more subtle than the poet's; Chaucer leaves the
  reader's sympathies equally divided, despite the fact that he says
  plainly that Arcite was in the wrong, because he violated the compact of
  the two kinsmen to assist each other in love.</p>

  <p>We must now consider what justification there is for <!-- Page 24
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24"></a>[24]</span> believing that
  the main plot of <i>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</i> was suggested by <i>The
  Knightes Tale</i>. Firstly, as has already been pointed out, the nuptials
  of Theseus form the beginning of both play and poem; though in the poem
  the actual ceremony has been performed, and it is his triumphant return
  to the city of Athens that is interrupted by the widows' appeal for
  justice; and in the play the action passes in the three or four days
  before the marriage. Secondly, the wedding-day is the first of May, and
  there are two references to that "observance of May"<a
  name="Int_16"></a><a href="#IntN_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> which is given
  by Chaucer as the reason both for Emilia's walking in the garden and for
  Arcite's seeking of the grove where Palamon lay hid.<a
  name="Int_17"></a><a href="#IntN_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Thirdly, it can
  hardly be doubted that Shakespeare took the name of Philostrate from
  Chaucer; Egeus he would find also in North's Plutarch as the name of the
  father of Theseus; <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_25"></a>[25]</span> and it is possible that Chaucer's names
  for the champions, Ligurge and Emetreus, may have suggested Lysander and
  Demetrius. Finally, there are two or three minor indications; Lysander
  and Demetrius fight, or attempt to fight, for Helena, in the "wood near
  Athens," just as Palamon and Arcite fight for Emilia in the grove<a
  name="Int_18"></a><a href="#IntN_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>; Theseus is a
  keen huntsman both in the poem and in the play<a name="Int_19"></a><a
  href="#IntN_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>; and he refers<a name="Int_20"></a><a
  href="#IntN_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> to his conquest of Thebes, which, as
  we have seen, is described in <i>The Knightes Tale</i>.</p>

  <p>Apart from these details, I do not think Shakespeare is indebted to
  Chaucer. It is conceivable that the story of Palamon and Arcite affected,
  but did not supply, the plot of the four lovers in <i>A Midsummer-Night's
  Dream</i>; but Shakespeare has added a second woman. This completion of
  the antithesis is characteristic of his early work; with a happy ending
  in view, the characters must fall into pairs, whereas with Palamon,
  Arcite, and Emilia, one of the men must be removed. There is nothing to
  prevent the supposition that Shakespeare was acquainted from boyhood with
  Chaucer's story&mdash;either in Chaucerian form or possibly in the shape
  of a chap-book&mdash;and that he constructed a first draft of <i>The Two
  Noble Kinsmen</i> quite early in his career as a playwright, subsequently
  laying it aside as unsatisfactory, and, in his declining years,
  collaborating with another or others to produce the play on that
  theme.</p>

<h3>§ 2. THE GROTESQUE PLOT: BOTTOM AND
THE ASS'S HEAD: WITH THE INTERLUDE
OF <i>PYRAMUS AND THISBE</i></h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"But, for I am a man noght textuel,</p>

<!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>

<h3>II</h3>

  <p>The second portion of our study will not detain us long, as there are
  no literary sources for the "rude mechanicals," and their interlude of
  Pyramus and Thisbe is derived from a well-known classical story.
  Shakespeare draws them from life, and from his own observation of
  Warwickshire rustics, as he drew the two Gobbos, Launce, Christopher Sly,
  and a host of minor characters. Doubtless he had met many of the crew of
  patches, perhaps beneath the roof of "Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of
  Wincot," where we may suppose him to have made merry with "Stephen Sly,
  and old John Naps of Greece, and Peter Turf, and Henry Pimpernell."</p>

  <p>Bottom takes his name from the wooden reel or spool on which thread is
  wound; "bottom" simply meaning the base or foundation of the reel. The
  names of his comrades have no specific connection with the trades they
  ply; but "Starveling" is appropriate by tradition for a tailor&mdash;it
  takes seven tailors to make a man.</p>

  <p>The episode of Bottom's "translation," or transformation into an ass,
  may have been suggested to Shakespeare by a passage in Reginald Scot's
  <i>Discovery of Witchcraft</i> (1584)&mdash;a <!-- Page 30 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30"></a>[30]</span> book with which he must
  have been acquainted, as we shall see in discussing the fairy-section of
  the play. Scot mentions the supposed power of witches to change men into
  animals, and quotes (in order to discredit) some recorded instances.
  Chief among these is the story<a name="Int_21"></a><a
  href="#IntN_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> of an English sailor abroad, who got
  into the power of a witch and was transformed by her into an ass, so that
  when he attempted to rejoin his crew, he was beaten from the gangway with
  contempt. This will be found in the third chapter of Scot's fifth book:
  <i>Of a man turned into an asse, and returned againe into a man by one of
  Bodin's witches: S. Augustine's opinion thereof</i>. "Bodin" is Jean
  Bodin, who wrote a book <i>de Magorum Daemonomania</i> (1581; a French
  version was published in the previous year), and mentions this story
  (lib. 2, cap. vi.). According to Scot, Bodin takes the story "out of
  <i>M. Mal.</i> [<i>Malleus Maleficarum</i>], which tale was delivered to
  <i>Sprenger</i> by a knight of the Rhodes."</p>

  <p>Scot mentions further the famous story of the <i>Golden Ass</i> of
  Apuleius<a name="Int_22"></a><a href="#IntN_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>; a
  legend of the reappearance of one of the Popes, a hundred years after his
  death, with an ass's head; and gives a charm to put an ass's head on a
  man.<a name="Int_23"></a><a href="#IntN_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>From these instances a literary origin for Bottom's transformation
  seems probable but Shakespeare may himself <!-- Page 31 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31"></a>[31]</span> have fallen in with a
  survival of the witch-superstition Almost while writing these words I
  receive first-hand evidence that such a tradition is not yet extinct in
  Welford-on-Avon, a village, four miles from Stratford, with which
  Shakespeare must have been perfectly familiar. The witch, as usual, was
  an old woman, credited with the "evil eye" and the power of causing the
  death of cattle and farm-stock by "overlooking" them; and the native of
  Welford, from whom the story was communicated to me, would be prepared to
  produce eye-witnesses of various transformations of the old woman into
  some kind of animal&mdash;transformations effected not only at Welford,
  but even in the centre of Stratford on market-day!</p>

  <p>Shakespeare had probably met with the story of Pyramus and Thisbe in
  more than one form. Golding's translation in 1575 of the story in Ovid's
  <i>Metamorphoses</i><a name="Int_24"></a><a
  href="#IntN_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> is reprinted in this book<a
  name="Int_25"></a><a href="#IntN_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>; Chaucer
  included the <i>Legend of Thisbe of Babylon</i> as the second story in
  the <i>Legend of Good Women</i>; and there appears to have been also "a
  boke intituled Perymus and Thesbye," for which the Stationers' Register
  record the granting of a license in 1562. There is, too, a poem on the
  subject by I. Thomson in Robinson's <i>Handeful of Pleasant Delites</i>
  (1584).</p>

  <p>The <i>Historia de Piramo e Tisbe</i> was very early in print in
  Italy, and continued to be popular in chap-book form until the nineteenth
  century at least.</p>

<!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
In his commentary on <i>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</i> in
the larger Temple Shakespeare, Professor Gollancz points
out the existence of a Pyramus and Thisbe play, discovered
by him in a manuscript at the British Museum.<a name="Int_26"></a><a href="#IntN_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> This MS.
is a Cambridge commonplace book of about 1630, containing
poems attributed to Ben Jonson, Sir Walter Raleigh and
others, though the greater portion of the contents appear to
be topical verses and epigrams unsigned. Amongst these is
"Tragaedia miserrima Pyrami &amp; Thisbes fata enuncians.
Historia ex Publio Ovidio deprompta. Authore N.R."
In the margins are written corresponding passages in Latin
from Ovid, whose story it follows closely.

  <p>The play is in blank verse of a poor kind with occasional rhyming
  couplets. After a prologue begins "Actus Primus and ultimus"; there are
  only five scenes in all, and the whole is quite short. The characters
  consist of Iphidius, father of Pyramus; Labetrus, father of Thisbe; their
  children, the protagonists; their respective servants, Straton and
  Clitipho; and Casina, "ancilla" or handmaid to Thisbe. There is also "a
  raging liones from ye woods." The moral of the play, as stated by
  Iphidius, is that</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"the erraticall motions in children's actions</p>
      <p>Must to a regular form by parents be reduc'd."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These lines, and others in the play, would gain by being "reduc'd to a
  regular form."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

  <p>In <i>The Midsummer-Night's Dream</i>, Shakespeare presents a
  conception of fairy-land as original as that which owes its propagation
  to Perrault and the other French collectors of fairy-tales; its merits as
  a popular delineation of the fairy-world are proved by the fact that it
  has obtained the sanction and approval of tradition, passing almost at
  once into an accepted literary convention; so that even to-day it is not
  easy to shake off the inherited impression that the fairies are only what
  Shakespeare shows them to be. He did not, of course, invent them; he had
  doubtless both read of them and heard tales of them; but he invested them
  with a delicate and graceful fancy that has held the popular imagination
  ever since. Thanks to him, the modern English conception of the fairies
  is different from the conceptions prevalent in other countries, and
  infinitely more picturesque and pleasant.</p>

  <p>As before, it will be convenient to deal first with the names of his
  characters.</p>

  <p><i>Oberon</i> is the English transliteration of the French Auberon in
  the romance of <i>Huon of Bordeaux</i>, and Auberon <!-- Page 36 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36"></a>[36]</span> is probably merely the
  French counterpart of Alberich or Albrich, a dwarf occurring in the
  German <i>Nibelungenlied</i> and other works. Etymologically Alberich is
  composed of <i>alb</i> = elf and <i>rich</i> = king. The name Oberon
  appears first in English literature in Lord Berners' translation of
  <i>Huon of Bordeaux</i> (c. 1534), and afterwards in Spenser<a
  name="Int_27"></a><a href="#IntN_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> and in Robert
  Greene's play <i>James IV</i>, which was acted in 1589.<a
  name="Int_28"></a><a href="#IntN_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> But the king of
  the fairies in Chaucer<a name="Int_29"></a><a
  href="#IntN_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> is Pluto, and the queen
  Proserpine.</p>

  <p><i>Titania.</i> Proserpine is the wife of Pluto (in Greek, form,
  Persephone, wife of Dis). In Elizabethan times, Campion's charming poem
  "Hark, all you ladies that do sleep"<a name="Int_30"></a><a
  href="#IntN_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> keeps the name of "the fairy-queen
  Proserpina." Shakespeare appears to have taken the name Titania from
  Ovid,<a name="Int_31"></a><a href="#IntN_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> who uses
  it as an epithet of Diana, as being the sister of Sol or Helios, the
  Sun-god, a Titan. Scot, in his <i>Discovery of Witchcraft</i>,<a
  name="Int_32"></a><a href="#IntN_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> gives Diana as
  one of the names of the "lady of the fairies"; and James I, in his <!--
  Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
  <i>Demonology</i> (1597) refers to a "fourth kind of sprites, which by
  the Gentiles was called Diana and her wandering court, and amongst us
  called the Phairie."</p>

  <p>Curiously enough in Shakespeare's most famous description of the Fairy
  Queen, she is called Queen Mab;<a name="Int_33"></a><a
  href="#IntN_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> this is said to be of Celtic
  derivation. Mercutio's catalogue of Mab's attributes and functions
  corresponds closely with the description of Robin Goodfellow.</p>

  <p><i>Puck</i> is strictly not a proper name; and in the quartos and
  folios of <i>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</i>, Puck, Robin, and Robin
  Goodfellow are used indiscriminately. In no place in the text is he
  addressed as "Puck"; it is always "Robin"<a name="Int_34"></a><a
  href="#IntN_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> (once<a name="Int_35"></a><a
  href="#IntN_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> "Goodfellow" is added). In the last
  lines of the play he twice refers to himself as "<i>an</i> honest Puck"
  and "<i>the</i> Puck," <a name="Int_36"></a><a
  href="#IntN_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> showing that the word is originally a
  substantive. Dr. J.A.H. Murray has very kindly allowed the slips of the
  <i>New English Dictionary</i> which contain notes for the article 'Puck'
  to be inspected; his treatment of the word will be awaited with much
  interest. The earliest and most important reference is to Prof. A.S.
  Napier's <i>Old English Glosses</i> (1900), 191, where in a list of
  glosses of the eleventh century to Aldhelm's <i>Aenigmata</i> <!-- Page
  38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38"></a>[38]</span> occurs
  "larbula [i. e. larvula], <i>puca</i>." Prof. Napier notes that O.E.
  p&#363;ca, "a goblin," whence N.E. <i>Puck</i>, is a well authenticated
  word. Dr. Bradley suggests that the source might be a British word, from
  which the Irish <i>púca</i> would be borrowed; this word <i>pooka</i>, as
  well as the allied <i>poker</i>, has already been treated in the
  <i>N.E.D.</i> <i>Puck</i>, <i>pouke</i>, we find in O.E. (Old English
  Miscellany, <i>E.E.T.S.</i>, 76), in Piers Plowman, and surviving in
  Spenser; but there are countless analogous forms: <i>puckle</i>,
  <i>pixy</i>, <i>pisgy</i>, in English, and perhaps (through Welsh)
  <i>bug</i>, the old word for <i>bugbear</i>, <i>bogy</i>, <i>bogle</i>,
  etc.; <i>puki</i> in Icelandic; <i>pickel</i> in German; and many more.<a
  name="Int_37"></a><a href="#IntN_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We may note here the euphemistic tendency to call powerful spirits by
  propitiatory names. Just as the Greeks called the Furies "Eumenides," the
  benevolent ones, so is Robin called Good-fellow; the ballad of <i>Tam
  Lin</i><a name="Int_38"></a><a href="#IntN_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> refers
  to them as "gude neighbours"; the Gaels<a name="Int_39"></a><a
  href="#IntN_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> term a fairy "a woman of peace"; and
  Professor Child points out the same fact in relation to the neo-Greek
  nereids.<a name="Int_40"></a><a href="#IntN_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> Hence
  also "<i>sweet</i> puck."<a name="Int_41"></a><a
  href="#IntN_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> The names of the four attendant <!--
  Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
  fairies, Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustard-seed, are Shakespeare's
  invention, chosen perhaps to typify grace, lightness, speed, and
  smallness.</p>

  <p>The <i>literary</i> sources on which Shakespeare, in writing of
  fairies, probably drew&mdash;or those, at least, on which he could have
  drawn&mdash;can be shortly stated. We have already mentioned Scot's
  <i>Discovery of Witchcraft</i> (1584); this was no doubt the chief source
  of information regarding Puck or Robin Goodfellow, as well as of the
  fairies themselves. Shakespeare was doubtless also familiar with the
  treatment accorded to the fairy-world by Chaucer<a name="Int_42"></a><a
  href="#IntN_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> and Spenser<a name="Int_43"></a><a
  href="#IntN_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and with the many tales of
  supernatural beings in romances like <i>Huon of Bordeaux</i> and others
  of the Arthurian cycle. There is also a black-letter tract concerning
  Robin Goodfellow,<a name="Int_44"></a><a
  href="#IntN_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> but no one has yet proved that this
  pamphlet was in print before 1628, the date of the earliest surviving
  edition. Ultimately, however, this matters little, because the tract is
  evidently drawn largely from oral traditions about Robin, and so has a
  source common with that of much of Shakespeare's fairy-lore.</p>

  <p>Minor allusions, chiefly, to Robin Goodfellow, he may <!-- Page 40
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40"></a>[40]</span> have met with
  in various works<a name="Int_45"></a><a
  href="#IntN_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> published before the assumed date of
  the play; but these, again, add nothing which Shakespeare could not have
  learned just as well from the superstitions of his day. What these were,
  and how he handled them, we must now proceed to discuss.</p>

  <p>In approaching a subject such as fairy-lore, it is necessary to
  prepare the mind of the reader to go back to days not merely
  pre-Christian but even pre-national. Our fairies can no more justly be
  called English than can our popular poetry. Folk-lore&mdash;the study of
  the traditional beliefs and customs of the common people&mdash;is a
  science invented centuries too late;<a name="Int_46"></a><a
  href="#IntN_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> for lack of evidence, it is largely
  theoretical. But it teaches its students continually to look further
  afield, and to compare the tales, ballads, superstitions, rites, and
  mythologies of one country with those of another. The surprising results
  thus obtained must not make us think that one country has borrowed from
  another; we must throw our minds back to a common ancestry and common
  creeds. "The attempt to discriminate modern national characteristics in
  the older stratum of European folk-lore is not only idle but mischievous,
  because <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_41"></a>[41]</span> it is based upon the unscientific
  assumption that existing differences, which are the outcome of
  comparatively recent historical conditions, have always existed." These
  are the wise words of a sound folk-lorist,<a name="Int_47"></a><a
  href="#IntN_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> and should be laid to heart by all
  who take up the study.</p>

  <p>We cannot begin to investigate the origins of the fairy superstition
  in the cradle of the world; we must be content to realise that there was
  a creed concerning supernatural beings common to all the European
  branches of the Aryan peoples, Greek, Roman, Celt or Teuton. When Thomas
  Nashe wrote in 1594 of "the Robbin-good-fellowes, Elfes, Fairies,
  Hobgoblins of our latter age, which idolatrous former daies and the
  fantasticall world of Greece ycleaped <i>Fawnes</i>, <i>Satyres</i>,
  <i>Dryades</i>, and <i>Hamadryades</i>," he spoke more truly than he
  knew.<a name="Int_48"></a><a href="#IntN_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

  <p>First of all, let us consider the word <i>fairy</i>. Strictly, this is
  a substantive meaning either "the land of the fays," or else "the
  fay-people" collectively; it is also used as an equivalent for
  "enchantment." It was originally, therefore, incorrect to speak of
  "<i>a</i> fairy";<a name="Int_49"></a><a
  href="#IntN_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> the singular term is "<i>a</i> fay,"
  as opposed to "<i>the</i> fairy." <i>Fay</i> is derived, through French,
  from the Low Latin <i>fata</i>, misunderstood as a <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42"></a>[42]</span> feminine singular; it
  is in fact the plural of <i>Fatum</i>, and means "the Fates."</p>

  <p>Reversing the chronological order, let us proceed to compare the
  functions of these beings. The Fates, whether the Greek <i>Moirae</i> or
  the Roman <i>Parcae</i>, were three in number, and were variously
  conceived as goddesses of birth or of death; the elements of the
  primitive idea are, at least, comprised in the conception that they
  allotted man his fate; we may also note that the metaphor of
  <i>spinning</i> was used in connection with their duties.</p>

  <p>Leaving classical lands and times, we find in the tenth century,
  amongst the Eddic Lays of northern Europe, the following
  passage:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It was in the olden days ... when Helgi the stout of heart was born
  of Borghild, in Braeholt. Night lay over the house when the Fates came to
  forecast the hero's life. They said that he should be called the most
  famous of kings and the best among princes. With power they twisted the
  strands of fate for Borghild's son in Braeholt...."<a
  name="Int_50"></a><a href="#IntN_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Here the "Fates" are the "Norns" of the northern mythology. We find
  them practising the same functions again in twelfth century Saxo
  Grammaticus,<a name="Int_51"></a><a href="#IntN_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
  who calls them <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_43"></a>[43]</span> "three maidens"; their caprices are shown
  when two of them bestow good temper and beauty on Fridleif's son Olaf,
  and the third mars their gifts by endowing the boy with
  niggardliness.</p>

  <p>In commenting upon both the Eddic Lay and the Danish Historian, the
  editors remark that this point of the story&mdash;the bestowal of gifts
  at birth&mdash;survives in the <i>chanson de geste</i> of Ogier the
  Dane,<a name="Int_52"></a><a href="#IntN_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> whose
  relations with the fairy-world may be narrated shortly as follows.<a
  name="Int_53"></a><a href="#IntN_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

  <p>At the birth of Ogier the Dane, five fairies promised him strength,
  bravery, success, beauty, and love; after them came Morgan le Fay, whose
  gift was that, after a glorious career, Ogier should come to live with
  her at her castle of Avalon. When the hero was over a hundred years of
  age, Morgan caused him to be wrecked near Avalon. In his wanderings he
  comes to an orchard, where he eats an apple. A beautiful <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44"></a>[44]</span> lady
  approaches whom he mistakes for the Virgin; but she tells him she is
  Morgan le Fay. She puts a ring on his finger and he becomes young; she
  puts a crown on his head, and he forgets the past. For two hundred years
  he lives in unearthly delights, and the years seem to him to be but
  twenty. He then returns to earth to champion Christendom; but after
  triumphing over his foes he returns to Avalon.<a name="Int_54"></a><a
  href="#IntN_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The tale of Ogier was long popular in Denmark&mdash;of which country
  he is the national hero&mdash;and also in France; and the notion of
  supernatural gifts at birth has obtained a very wide vogue. But Ogier's
  story also exhibits another very popular piece of superstition&mdash;that
  of a journey to or a sojourn in the supernatural world.<a
  name="Int_55"></a><a href="#IntN_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> Our English <!--
  Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
  parallel to Ogier, as Professor Child points out,<a name="Int_56"></a><a
  href="#IntN_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> is Thomas of Erceldoune.</p>

  <p>This leads us to the consideration of three English metrical Romances,
  which in all probability are derived from French sources, containing
  accounts of the visits to fairy-land made by Thomas of Erceldoune,
  Launfal, and Orfeo. The first and last of these are also known in the
  form of ballads; whether these ballads derive directly from the romances,
  or may be supposed to have existed side by side with them in the
  fifteenth century, is a question which must not delay us here. The
  romances and the ballads may all have been known to Shakespeare in
  book-form or in tradition.</p>

  <p>The romance of <i>Thomas of Erceldoune</i> is a poem in three "fyttes"
  or sections, which is preserved wholly or in part in five manuscripts, of
  which the earliest may be dated about 1435. The poem tells us that Thomas
  of Erceldoune's prophetic power was a gift from the queen of Elf-land,
  with whom he paid a visit to her realm. The first "fytte" is occupied in
  narrating his sojourn;<a name="Int_57"></a><a
  href="#IntN_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> while the other two set forth the
  predictions with which the queen supplied him. The romance is probably of
  Scottish origin, as the prophecies treat mainly of Scottish history; but
  the first "fytte" (which alone concerns us here, and indeed appears to be
  <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
  separate in origin from the other two) refers to an "older story." This,
  Professor Child says, "was undoubtedly a romance which narrated the
  adventure of Thomas with the elf queen <i>simply</i>, without
  specification of his prophecies."</p>

  <p>Doubtless the older story was not originally attached to Thomas of
  Erceldoune, who, as "Thomas Rymour of Ercildoune," is a historical
  character. He lived, as is proved by contemporary documents, in the
  thirteenth century, at Ercildoune (Earlstoun on the banks of the Leader
  in Berwickshire), and gained a reputation as a "rymour," <i>i.e.</i> poet
  and prophet&mdash;in which character he was venerated by the folk for
  centuries.</p>

  <p>But the Rymour does not concern us; the tale of a mortal's visit to
  elf-land would have been told of some one, whether Thomas or another; he
  was a prophet, and prophets needed explanation. His journal to
  fairy-land, as narrated in the fifteenth-century romance, survives in the
  well-known ballad of <i>Thomas the Rhymer</i>.<a name="Int_58"></a><a
  href="#IntN_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Two points in romance and ballad may be noted. (i) In the romance the
  lady shows Thomas four roads, leading respectively to heaven, paradise,
  purgatory, and hell, besides the fair castle of Elf-land. The ballad is
  content with three roads, to heaven, hell, and Elf-land. (ii) Both in
  <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
  the romance and the ballad, <i>and also in Ogier the Dane</i>, the hero
  makes the same mistake, of supposing his supernatural visitor to be the
  Virgin Mary.<a name="Int_59"></a><a
  href="#IntN_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A curious point about the first "fytte" is that it opens (ll. 1-18) in
  the first person; at line 41 Thomas is mentioned, and the poem continues
  in the third person to the end, with a single and sudden change to the
  first in line 208. I do not know whether any assumption as to the
  authorship of the romance can be based on such facts; the "I" question in
  early popular poetry forms an interesting study in itself.<a
  name="Int_60"></a><a href="#IntN_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The English romance of <i>Sir Launfal</i>, which survives in a
  manuscript<a name="Int_61"></a><a href="#IntN_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> of
  the fifteenth century, is therein said to have been "made by Thomas
  Chestre"; but in fact it is chiefly a translation from Marie de France's
  lay of <i>Lanval</i>, dating from the middle of the thirteenth century.
  The translator, Thomas Chestre, has, however, taken incidents from other
  "lais" by Marie de France, and enlarged the whole until it is some three
  hundred lines longer than the French original.</p>

<!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>

  <p>Shakespeare may have read the tale in print. <i>Sir Lambewell</i>
  appears to have been printed about 1558,<a name="Int_62"></a><a
  href="#IntN_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> and to have remained in circulation
  at least until 1575,<a name="Int_63"></a><a
  href="#IntN_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> but no complete copy is now known. A
  single MS. version of 1650 survives, however, in the Percy Folio.<a
  name="Int_64"></a><a href="#IntN_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> This is another
  translation from the same French original, but made by some one
  acquainted with Thomas Chestre's version.</p>

  <p>The story as told in the first of these manuscripts may be condensed
  as follows. Launfal had been ten years a steward to King Arthur before
  the King's marriage. He did not like Guinevere, who gave him no gift at
  her wedding; so he asked leave of the King to go home and bury his
  father. He went to Caerleon, with two knights given him by Arthur, and
  sojourned with the mayor; but when his money was spent, he fell into
  debt, and his knights returned to Arthur's court in rags; but at
  Launfal's request, they gave out that he was faring well.</p>

  <p>One day Launfal rode out in poor attire into the forest, and sat him
  under a tree to rest. After a while, two fair <!-- Page 49 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49"></a>[49]</span> damsels, beautifully
  attired and bearing a gold basin and a silk towel, approached him, and
  bade him come speak with their lady, Dame Triamour, daughter to the King
  of Olyroun, king of fairy. Launfal was led to where the lady lay, and
  "all his love in her was light."</p>

  <p>On the morrow she promised him rich presents, and said she would come
  to him whenever he wished for her in a secret place; but he was never to
  boast of her love. Her presents came to him at the mayor's house of
  Caerleon, and he spent his riches charitably.</p>

  <p>The King, hearing of an exploit of Launfal's, summoned him back to
  court. The Queen tempted him, but he repulsed her by saying he loved a
  fairer woman; this of course lost him Triamour. Guinevere (by a trick
  common in romances) accused Launfal to Arthur; but he was saved from
  disgrace by the appearance of Triamour, who then carried him off into
  fairy-land to Olyroun.</p>

  <p>The romance of <i>Sir Orpheo</i>, a mediaeval version of the classical
  story of Orpheus and Eurydice, has come down to us in three
  manuscripts,<a name="Int_65"></a><a href="#IntN_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a>
  two of which are not quite complete, which are to be assigned to the
  fifteenth century at latest. <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_50"></a>[50]</span> As in the case of <i>Launfal</i>, it is
  doubtless a translation from the French; but as there is no extant
  original, this can only be presumed. Orpheus becomes Orpheo or Orfeo, and
  Eurydice becomes Erodys, Heurodis, or Meroudys; in the last the initial
  letter may be due to the <i>m</i> in "dame," the word preceding it.</p>

  <p>The story is told as follows.</p>

  <p>In all the world there was no better harper than King Orfeo [Sir
  Orpheo], and no fairer lady than dame Meroudys. On a morning in the
  beginning of May, the queen went forth with her ladies to an orchard, and
  fell asleep under an "ympe"<a name="Int_66"></a><a
  href="#IntN_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> tree till it was long past noon. When
  her ladies woke her, she cried aloud, tore her clothes, and disfigured
  herself with her nails. They sought assistance and put her to bed in her
  chamber, whither the king came to visit her, and ask her what might help
  her. She told him how in her sleep she had been bidden by a knight to
  come and speak with his lord the king; she refused, but the king came to
  her, with a hundred knights and a hundred ladies in white on white
  steeds, and his crown was all of precious stones. He bore her away to a
  fair palace, and showed her his possessions. Then he took her back, but
  bade her be beneath the tree on the morrow, when she should go with them
  and stay with them for ever.</p>

  <p>King Orfeo was greatly distressed, and none could advise him. On the
  morrow he took his queen and ten hundred <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51"></a>[51]</span> knights to guard her
  beneath the ympe tree; but in vain, she was away with the fairy, and they
  knew not whither. King Orfeo in grief called together his barons and
  knights and squires, and bade them obey his high steward as regent; he
  himself went forth barefoot and in poor attire into the wilderness, with
  naught but his harp.</p>

  <p>So for ten winters he abode in the forest and on the heath, in a
  hollow tree, or under leaves and grass, till his frame shrank and his
  beard grew long; and ever and anon, when the day was fair, he would play
  his harp, and the beasts of the forest and the birds on bush and briar
  would come about him to hearken.</p>

  <p>Then on a hot day he saw the king of fairy and his retinue riding with
  hounds and blowing horns; and again he saw a great host of knights with
  drawn swords; and again he saw sixty ladies, gentle and gay, riding on
  palfreys and bearing hawks on their wrists. Their falcons had good sport,
  and Orfeo drew nigh to watch; and looking on the face of one of the
  ladies, he recognised Meroudys. They gazed at each other speechless, and
  tears ran from her eyes; but the other ladies bore her away. The king
  followed them to a fair country where there was neither hill nor dale,
  and into a castle, gaining entrance as a minstrel. Then he saw many men
  and women sleeping on every side, seemingly dead; among them he again
  beheld his wife. And he came before the king and queen of that realm, and
  harped so sweetly that the king promised him whatever he might ask. He
  asked <!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_52"></a>[52]</span> for the fair dame Meroudys; and he took
  her by the hand, and they fared homewards.</p>

  <p>In his own city he lodged awhile in poor quarters, and then went forth
  to play his harp; and meeting his steward, who knew the harp but not his
  master, told him he had found the harp ten winters ago, by the side of a
  man eaten by lions. This evil news caused the steward to swoon, whereupon
  King Orfeo revealed himself, and sent for dame Meroudys. She came in a
  triumphant procession; there was mirth and melody; and they were
  new-crowned king and queen. Harpers of Bretayne heard this tale and made
  the lay and called it after the king</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>"That Orfeo hight, as men well wote; Good is the lay, sweet is the
  note!"</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>The ballad which represents the débris of this romance has only been
  recovered in a single text, from the memory of an old man in Unst,
  Shetland, and it is incomplete in verse-form, though the reciter
  remembered the gist of the story. This version of the ballad is further
  complicated by the fact that the old man sang it to a refrain which
  appears to be Unst pronunciation of Danish&mdash;a startling instance of
  phonetic tradition.</p>

  <p>It is not, however, to be understood from this that it was impossible
  for Shakespeare to have heard this ballad; English versions <i>may</i>
  have been current in his time. But even so, the ballad would add nothing
  to the knowledge he <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_53"></a>[53]</span> might gain elsewhere; it is simply a short
  form of the romance altered by tradition.<a name="Int_67"></a><a
  href="#IntN_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There are half-a-dozen other English and Scottish ballads concerning
  fairies, none of much importance touching our present theme. They may be
  best studied in Child's collection, Nos. 35-41, where under <i>Tam
  Lin</i> he has put together the main features of fairy-lore revealed in
  traditional ballads.<a name="Int_68"></a><a
  href="#IntN_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> One or two such points may be noted
  here.</p>

  <p>We have seen that Ogier saw the supernatural lady after plucking and
  eating an apple from a tree. Thomas of Erceldoune, Launfal, and Meroudys,
  are sleeping or lying beneath a tree when they see their various
  visitors. Tam Lin in the ballad was taken by the fairies while sleeping
  under an apple tree. Malory<a name="Int_69"></a><a
  href="#IntN_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> tells us that Lancelot went to sleep
  about noon (traditionally the dangerous hour) beneath an apple tree, and
  was bewitched by Morgan le Fay. In modern Greek folk-lore, certain trees
  are said to be dangerous to lie under at noon, as the sleeper may be
  taken by the nereids, who correspond to our fairies.</p>

  <p>At certain intervals&mdash;every seven years, the ballads
  say&mdash;the fiend of hell takes a tithe from the fairies, usually
  preferring <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_54"></a>[54]</span> one who is fair and of good flesh and
  blood. Hence in <i>Thomas of Erceldoune</i>,<a name="Int_70"></a><a
  href="#IntN_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> the elf queen is anxious that he
  should leave her realm, because she thinks the foul fiend would choose
  him (ll. 219-224).</p>

  <p>The notion of the fairies' demand of a tithe of produce, agricultural
  or domestic, is parallel to this sacrifice.<a name="Int_71"></a><a
  href="#IntN_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A third point on which fairy-lore usually insists is that the steeds
  of the fairies shall be white; here <i>Thomas of Erceldoune</i> is at
  variance with the other poems, the elf-queen's palfrey being a
  dapple-grey. It is curious to learn that this superstition still
  survives. "At that time there was a gentleman who had been taken by the
  fairies, and made an officer among them, and it was often people would
  see him and her riding on a white horse at dawn and in the evening."<a
  name="Int_72"></a><a href="#IntN_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It will have been observed that the tale of Orfeo varies considerably
  from the classical tale of Orpheus; but this is not surprising; no one
  can imagine that it comes direct from the classics. A French original is
  presumed; indeed, there are references in early "lais" to a "Lai
  d'Orphey," indicating the existence of a poem which was probably the
  original of our <i>King Orfeo</i>. This original is presumed to have been
  a Breton lay, one of the many that were popular in the eleventh and
  twelfth centuries, and the English version <!-- Page 55 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"></a>[55]</span> may have been taken
  from the supposed source through a French form.</p>

  <p>Now, these Breton lays were chiefly on Celtic subjects, and placed
  their scenes in the Celtic realms of Great Britain, Little Britain,
  Ireland, or Scotland. The bards of Armorica doubtless picked up a good
  story wherever they could find it; and the classical story of Orpheus and
  Eurydice would appeal strongly to Celts, who have always been famous for
  harping. But why should these early Celtic singers have made such changes
  in the story, <i>unless they had a similar story of their own</i> which
  was confused with it? The parallel story has been adduced by Professor
  Kittredge<a name="Int_73"></a><a href="#IntN_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> from
  an Irish epic tale, The Wooing (or Courtship) of Etain. The portions of
  the story which concern us here follow.</p>

  <p>Eochaid Airemm, king of Ireland, found him a wife in Etain daughter of
  Etar in the Bay of Cichmany, and with her Mider of Bri Leith (a fairy
  chief) was in love. On a summer's day, as the king sat on the heights of
  Tara beholding the plain of Breg, a strange young warrior appeared, gave
  his name as Mider, and challenged Eochaid to a game of chess for a wager.
  Many were the games they played, and at first Eochaid won, and bade Mider
  carry out <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_56"></a>[56]</span> certain tasks. But at last Eochaid was
  defeated, and Mider for his reward asked to be allowed to hold Etain in
  his arms and kiss her. Eochaid put him off for a month; at the end of
  which time he called together the armies of Ireland, and took Etain into
  the palace, and shut and locked the doors, and ringed the house with
  guards. Yet at the appointed hour Mider stood in their midst, fairer than
  ever; and he sang to Etain:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<i>O fair-haired woman, will you come with me into a marvellous land
  wherein is music, where heads are covered with primrose hair and bodies
  are white as snow? There is no "mine" or "thine" there; white are teeth,
  and black are eyebrows, and cheeks are the hue of the foxglove, and eyes
  the hue of blackbirds' eggs.... We see everything on every side, yet no
  man seeth us. Though pleasant the plains of Ireland, yet are they a
  wilderness for him who has known the great plain</i>."</p>

  <p>But Etain would not go to him, before Eochaid was willing to resign
  her. And the king would not, yet allowed Mider to embrace her before him.
  Mider took his weapons into his left hand, and Etain with his right, and
  bore her away through the skylight. The guards outside beheld two swans
  flying, and they flew towards the elf-mound of Femun, which is called the
  Mound of the Fair-haired Women.</p>

  <p>For nine years Eochaid waged war against Mider, digging into the
  elf-mounds, until he hit upon the fairy-mansion; whereupon Mider sent to
  the side of the palace sixty women, all exactly like Etain. And first the
  king carried away the <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_57"></a>[57]</span> wrong woman, but when he returned to sack
  Bri Leith, Etain made herself known to him, and he bore her back to the
  palace at Tara.</p>

  <p>It is reasonable to suppose, then, that some Armorican bard, hearing
  the classical tale of Orpheus and Eurydice, remembered the Celtic legend
  of Eochaid and Etain, and grafted the one on the other. Hades became Bri
  Leith, or the vaguely-defined beautiful unknown country; but the
  classical names displaced the Celtic. The confusion, however, did not at
  once cease. In one of the MSS. of <i>Sir Orfeo</i> it is said that
  Orfeo's father</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">"Was comen of king Pluto,</p>
      <p>And his moder of king Juno"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>&mdash;confusion worse confounded. Moreover, as we have already seen,
  even Chaucer called the fairy-king Pluto and the queen Proserpina.</p>

  <p>Again, to hark back to the other romances, we have found the word
  <i>fay</i> attached to the name of King Arthur's sister Morgan. Nothing
  is more remarkably certain than the close and constant association in
  mediaeval lore of the fairies and the fairy-world with the Arthurian
  cycle of romance;<a name="Int_74"></a><a
  href="#IntN_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> King Arthur's sister was Morgan le
  Fay, whose son by Ogier was Merlin; and the romance of <i>Huon of
  Bordeaux</i>, which relates these facts, though strictly belonging to the
  Charlemagne <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_58"></a>[58]</span> cycle, contains the account of Oberon's
  bequest of his realm to King Arthur. Chaucer, whatever other doubts he
  may have had, was convinced on this point:&mdash;<a name="Int_75"></a><a
  href="#IntN_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"In th' olde daiès of the King Arthoure,</p>
      <p>Of which that Bretons speken gret honoure,</p>
      <p>Al was this land fulfild of fayerye;</p>
      <p>The elfqueen with hir joly companye</p>
      <p>Dauncèd ful ofte in many a grenè mede;</p>
      <p>This was the olde opinion as I rede."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now the Arthurian legends ultimately derive from Celtic tales, which
  must be supposed to have travelled from Wales into France by way of
  Brittany&mdash;Little Britain, or Armorica&mdash;in the eleventh and
  twelfth centuries; for there are Welsh versions independent of the Breton
  forms, though closely akin. Students of early Celtic literature have not
  as yet agreed about the historical relations between Welsh and Irish
  stories&mdash;whether the Welsh imposed their mythology and heroic
  legends on the Irish, or <i>vice versa</i>; but the general similarity
  between them is undeniable, and easily explicable by a common Celtic
  source.</p>

  <p>Everything, then, points to the Celtic legends as the chief origin of
  the mediaeval fairy-lore; and the early Celtic literature, although its
  study, complicated by an unfamiliar language, has only recently been
  undertaken scientifically, has <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_59"></a>[59]</span> already revealed an extremely rich and
  complete store of romance that extends over a thousand years. From
  manuscripts which are attributed to the twelfth century (and even so
  contain matter rightly belonging to the ninth or tenth), we can trace the
  development of a creed concerning supernatural beings through the
  succeeding centuries, down to a time at which the written account is
  displaced by recorded oral tradition. A race of beings, who must
  originally have fallen from the Celtic Olympus, continue to appear, with
  characteristics that remain the same in essence, and under a designation
  that may be heard in Ireland today, through ten centuries of Irish
  tradition and literature.<a name="Int_76"></a><a
  href="#IntN_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

  <p>These people are called in Irish mythology the <i>Tuatha Dé
  Danann</i>, described from at latest 1100 A.D. as <i>aes sidhe</i>, "the
  folk of the [fairy-] hillock;" the name for fairies in Ireland now is
  "the Sidhe."<a name="Int_77"></a><a href="#IntN_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>
  Originally, it may be, the <i>aes sidhe</i> were not identified with the
  <i>Tuatha Dé Danann</i>; and before the twelfth century the Sidhe were
  not associated with the Celtic belief in "a beautiful country beyond the
  sea," a happy land called by various names&mdash;Tir-nan-Og (the land of
  youth), Tir Tairngire (the land of promise)&mdash;which has now become
  "fairy-land." In the earliest heroic legends the <i>Tuatha Dé Danann</i>
  assist or protect mortal champions, and fall in love with mortal men and
  maids; but with the spread <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_60"></a>[60]</span> of Christianity (as might be expected)
  they lost many of their previous characteristics.<a name="Int_78"></a><a
  href="#IntN_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

  <p>To look back for a moment, we must note that so far we have touched no
  belief later than the fifteenth century, and already we have seen enough
  blending of various superstitions and legends to give our fairies a very
  mixed ancestry. Classical mythology, Celtic heroic sagas and northern
  Eddas in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, Saxo the Danish
  historian in the twelfth, and a series of romances, running through
  Celtic-Breton-French-English languages from the twelfth to fifteenth
  centuries&mdash;all combine to alter or add to the popular conception of
  fairies. Celtic Mider is of human stature, beautiful, powerful, dwelling
  beneath the earth; he attempts to carry off a mortal bride. Teutonic
  Alberich is a dwarf, presumably not handsome, but well disposed to
  mortals. But when we come to <i>Huon of Bordeaux</i> we find Oberon's
  characteristics are derived from varying sources. He himself describes<a
  name="Int_79"></a><a href="#IntN_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> to Huon, in a
  fantastic romance-style, which attempts to associate him with as many
  classic heroes as possible, his parentage and birth:&mdash;</p>

<!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>

  <p>"I shall show thee true, it is Julius Caesar engendered me on a lady
  of the Privy Isle ... the which is now named Chifalonny [Cephalonia] ...
  after a seven year Caesar passed by the sea as he went into Thessaly
  whereas he fought with Pompey; in his way he passed by Chifalonny, where
  my mother fetched him, and he fell in love with her because she showed
  him that he should discomfit Pompey, as he did." We are almost supplied
  with the date of Oberon's birth.</p>

  <p>He proceeds to narrate how all the fairies but one were invited to his
  birth, and that one, in anger, said that when he was three years old he
  should cease to grow; however, she repented immediately and added that he
  should be "the fairest creature that nature ever formed." Another fairy
  endowed him with the power of seeing into the minds of all men; and a
  third enabled him to go whither he would at a wish. "Moreover, if I will
  have a castle or a palace at my own device, incontinent it shall be made,
  and as soon gone again if I list; and what meat or wine that I will wish
  for, I shall have it incontinent."</p>

  <p>Elsewhere<a name="Int_80"></a><a href="#IntN_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a>
  in the romance his handsome equipment and dress are described; his gown,
  his bow, and above all his horn, "made by four ladies of the fairy," who
  endowed it with four gifts; it cured all diseases by its blast, it
  banished hunger and thirst, it brought joy to the heavy-hearted, and
  forced any one who heard to come at the wish of its owner.</p>

<!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>

  <p>Horns, in English folk-lore, appear to belong rather to elves than to
  fairies<a name="Int_81"></a><a
  href="#IntN_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>&mdash;the elves that haunt hills, and
  are known all over Europe; dwarfs, trolls, kobolds, pixies, and so forth.
  Teutonic witches are called horn-blowers. Again, the fairy-train or
  fairy-hunt is supposed to carry horns; we have seen it already in <i>Sir
  Orfeo</i>,<a name="Int_82"></a><a href="#IntN_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> and
  in <i>Thomas of Erceldoune</i>,<a name="Int_83"></a><a
  href="#IntN_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> the fairy-queen bears a horn about
  her neck.</p>

  <p>But this Oberon of <i>Huon of Bordeaux</i> is mortal, and is not
  pictured as being abnormal in stature, any more than Mider. Shakespeare's
  Oberon and Mider are invisible (or can make themselves so), both have
  supernatural powers, and both are immortal.</p>

  <p>The question of the <i>size</i> conventionally attributed to the
  fairies is of importance, because it shows that a confusion existed
  between the fays of romance with the elves of folk-superstition. Elves
  and their numerous counterparts in all European countries and
  elsewhere&mdash;we have just given a list of names which can easily be
  extended&mdash;are above all things <i>small</i>; they also are
  earth-dwellers, living in hills or underground chambers, and originally,
  perhaps, were supposed to be <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_63"></a>[63]</span> mischievous by nature. But even in
  Shakespeare's day, it would be impossible to say that fairies were
  benevolent and elves malevolent; the two kinds and their respective
  characteristics were already confused.</p>

  <p>Robin Goodfellow, the Puck, or Hobgoblin, is however essentially
  mischievous. In a book contemporary with our play we find:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Think me to be one of those <i>Familiares Lares</i> that were rather
  pleasantly disposed than endued with any hurtful influence, as Hob
  Thrust, Robin Goodfellow, and suchlike spirits, as they term them, of the
  buttery, famoused in every old wives' chronicle for their mad merry
  pranks."<a name="Int_84"></a><a href="#IntN_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But four years later, as we have seen,<a name="Int_85"></a><a
  href="#IntN_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> Nashe confounds elves with fairies in
  deriving all alike from fauns and dryads. Robin is "mad-merry," "jocund
  and facetious," "a cozening idle friar or some such rogue" [in origin],
  and so forth&mdash;simply described by Shakespeare as a "shrewd and
  knavish sprite." The forms of mischief in which he delights are described
  in <i>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</i>, II. i. 33-57, and all these "gests"
  may be found in the contemporary Robin Goodfellow literature;<a
  name="Int_86"></a><a href="#IntN_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> though we have
  observed that some <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_64"></a>[64]</span> of the functions attributed to Queen Mab
  in Mercutio's famous speech<a name="Int_87"></a><a
  href="#IntN_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> belong rightly to Robin.<a
  name="Int_88"></a><a href="#IntN_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus we see&mdash;to take into consideration but a few points of the
  myth&mdash;that the fairy-superstition and the elf-superstition were
  melted together in the popular pre-Shakespearean mind, and that
  Shakespeare himself, making a new division of the characteristics of the
  two, yet re-welded the whole into one realm by putting the Puck in
  subjection under the fairy king.</p>

  <p>The main characteristics of Shakespeare's fairies, then, may be
  summarised shortly:&mdash;<a name="Int_89"></a><a
  href="#IntN_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

  <p>They are a community under a king and queen, who hold a court; they
  are very small, light, swift, elemental; they share in the life of
  nature; they are fond of dancing and singing; they are invisible and
  immortal; they prefer night, and midnight is their favourite hour; they
  fall in love with mortals, steal babies and leave changelings, and usurp
  the function of Hymen in blessing the marriage-bed. Oberon, "king of
  shadows," can apparently see things hidden from Puck.<a
  name="Int_90"></a><a href="#IntN_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>

  <p>Titania, "a spirit of no common rate," is yet subject to passion and
  jealousy, and had a mortal friend, "a votaress of my order."<a
  name="Int_91"></a><a href="#IntN_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The fairy of folk-lore in Shakespeare's day is nearly everything that
  the fairies of <i>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</i> are; we may possibly
  except their exiguity, their relations in love with mortals, and their
  hymeneal functions. His conception of their size as infinitesimal at
  least differs from that of the popular stories, where (as far as can be
  ascertained) they are shown to be about the size of mortal children.</p>

  <p>We may conclude these remarks with the modern Irish-Catholic theory of
  the origin of the fairies:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>"When Lucifer saw himself in the glass, he thought himself equal with
  God. Then the Lord threw him <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_66"></a>[66]</span> out of Heaven, and all the angels that
  belonged to him. While He was 'chucking them out,' an archangel asked Him
  to spare some of them, and those that were falling are in the air still,
  and have power to wreck ships, and to work evil in the world."<a
  name="Int_92"></a><a href="#IntN_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

  </blockquote>

<p class="center">OBERON'S VISION.</p>

  <p><i>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</i>, like too many other plays of
  Shakespeare, has been unable to escape the inquisition of
  "deuteroscopists"&mdash;those who are always on the look-out for
  historical and other allusions. The dainty passage (II. i. 148-174), in
  which Oberon gives Puck directions how and where to find the magic herb
  that works the transformations of love in the rest of the play, appears
  to contain a reference to Elizabeth as "a fair vestal throned by the
  west" and "the imperial votaress." So much may be reasonably granted; but
  Warburton in his edition proceeded to identify "the mermaid on a
  dolphin's back" with Mary Queen of Scots, the dolphin of course being the
  Dauphin, and so forth. This interpretation of the alleged secret allegory
  was displaced in 1843 by one rather more plausible&mdash;though still
  needlessly fantastic.</p>

  <p><i>Oberon's Vision</i>, by the Rev. N.J. Halpin (Shakespeare Society,
  1843) attempts to prove that in composing this <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67"></a>[67]</span> passage Shakespeare was
  referring to the Earl of Leicester's attempt to win Elizabeth's hand,
  when she visited him at Kenilworth in 1575; the mermaid, uttering dulcet
  and harmonious breath, so that the rude sea grows civil, and the stars
  that shot from their spheres, are explained, by parallel passages from
  contemporary accounts, as parts of the pageant or "Princely Pleasures"
  which formed the Queen's entertainment. The Earl was simultaneously
  intriguing with Lettice, Countess of Essex, who ultimately became his
  wife; and it is she who, according to the Rev. Halpin, is intended by the
  "little western flower"; to him the passage means:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>"Cupid, on behalf of the Earl of Leicester, loosed an arrow at Queen
  Elizabeth; but the Virgin Queen's maidenhood was so unassailable that the
  bolt missed her, hitting the Countess of Essex, who succumbed."</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>In other words, Shakespeare mentions the Queen only in order to point
  out her rival's success!</p>

  <p>It is as unnecessary to discuss the degrees of probability in Halpin's
  identifications as it was for him to elaborate them. Certainly it is
  likely that Shakespeare intended a compliment to his queen; it is
  possible that the "mermaid on a dolphin's back" was a reminiscence of a
  pageant which he might have visited Kenilworth at the age of eleven to
  see; and it may be true that he meant to hint at Leicester.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, I think that another explanation is more obvious
  and more rational. Shakespeare had to <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68"></a>[68]</span> introduce into his play
  the magic herb which was to alter the loves of those into whose eyes it
  was squeezed. We may reasonably guess that he had read somewhere one of
  the many popular legends that explain why the violet is purple, why the
  rose is red, <i>etc.</i>; there are some in Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i><a
  name="Int_93"></a><a href="#IntN_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> which
  Shakespeare read in Golding's translation. He saw an opportunity of
  paying a graceful compliment to Elizabeth by saying that the magic
  flower, once white, had been empurpled by a shaft of Cupid's drawn at the
  fair vestal and imperial votaress, who yet passed on untouched;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>"And maidens call it love-in-idleness"</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;a popular name for the common pansy.</p>

  <p><a name="IntN_13"></a><a href="#Int_13">[13]</a> This opening, derived
  from Statius (see note, p. 13), serves merely to introduce the main
  story, much in the same way as the Theseus story in <i>A
  Midsummer-Night's Dream</i> is simply the "enveloping action" of the
  play.</p>

  16 and 27 October, and November, 1594. Against the first entry are the
  much-discussed letters "ne," which appear to mark a new play. It will be
  seen that according to the theory that <i>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</i>
  belongs to the winter of 1594-5, this Palamon and Arcite play was
  performed immediately before.</p>

  fantastic to interpret too literally Arcite's song to May&mdash;"I hope

  significance now remains, celebration of the rites of May is by no means
  extinct. See E.K. Chambers, <i>The Mediaeval Stage</i>, I. 117: "their
  object is to secure the beneficent influence of the fertilization spirit
  by bringing the persons or places to be benefited into direct contact
  with the physical embodiment of that spirit."</p>

  <p>Shakespeare's apparent confusion of a May-day with a Mid-summer-night
  may seem pardonable to the folk-lorist in the light of the fact that
  various folk-festivals appear to take place indiscriminately on May-day
  or Midsummer-day. See Chambers, <i>op. cit.</i> i. 114, 118, 126.</p>

  <p><a name="IntN_55"></a><a href="#Int_55">[55]</a> The mere mention of
  these subterranean explorations opens up an immense field of discussion
  and speculation that can here be only relegated to a note; we can treat
  at greater length none but those legends which bear directly on our
  subject. Odysseus visited Hades, Aeneas descended to Orcus or Tartarus,
  and they have their counterparts in every land and every mythology. Human
  aetiological tendencies supply explanations of any cavern or natural
  chasm&mdash;even a volcano must be the mouth of the entrance to hell or
  purgatory&mdash;from Taenarus, where Pluto carried off Proserpine, and
  the Sibyl's cavern, whence Aeneas sought the lower regions, to the famous
  Lough Dearg in Donegal, the entrance to "St. Patrick's Purgatory," and
  the Peak cavern in Derbyshire. The student may begin his researches with
  T. Wright's <i>St. Patrick's Purgatory</i> (1844). A very common tale in
  Celtic literature is that of the visit of some hero to the underworld and
  his seizure of some gift of civilisation&mdash;just as Prometheus stole
  fire from heaven.</p>

  <p><a name="IntN_91"></a><a href="#Int_91">[91]</a> How far Shakespeare
  associated his fairy queen Titania with her nominal parent Diana, is a
  question that would make matter for an elaborate study in mythology and
  mysticism, and might yet lead to no result. Diana is Luna in the heavens;
  Lucina (the goddess of child-birth) and the Huntress on earth; and Hecate
  in the underworld, goddess of enchantments and nocturnal incantations,
  often also identified with Proserpina. Titania is a votaress of the moon;
  we have seen that fairies are intimately concerned with mortal babies,
  and that there is a fairy-hunt (see the quotation from James I's
  <i>Demonology</i>, p. <a href="#Page_37">37</a> above); and we have also
  noted the confusion of Proserpina with the fairy-queen.&mdash;The
  <i>Tuatha Dé Danann</i> are said to be "the folk of
  <i>Danu</i>"&mdash;who is Danu? Hecate was called Trivia, on account of
  the above tripartition of Diana; her statues were set up where three
  roads met, and the fairy-queen in <i>Thomas the Rhymer</i> points out to
  him the three roads that lead to heaven, hell, and elf-land. Speculation
  is easily led astray.</p>

<h3>THE LEGEND OF PYRAMUS AND THISBE</h3>

  <p>From Arthur Golding's translation of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>
  (1575), Book IV, ff. 52-3.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">Within the town (of whose huge walls so monstrous high and thick,</p>
      <p class="i2">The fame is given Semiramis for making them of brick)</p>
      <p>Dwelt hard together two young folk, in houses joined so near,</p>
      <p>That under all one roof well nigh both twain conveyéd were.</p>
      <p>The name of him was Pyramus, and Thisbe call'd was she,</p>
      <p>So fair a man in all the East was none alive as he.</p>
      <p>Nor ne'er a woman, maid, nor wife in beauty like to her.</p>
      <p>This neighbourhood bred acquaintance first, this neighbourhood first did stir</p>
      <p>The secret sparks: this neighbourhood first an entrance in did show</p>
      <p>For love, to come to that to which it afterward did grow.</p>
      <p>And if that right had taken place they had been man and wife,</p>
      <p>But still their parents went about to let<a name="Pyr_1"></a><a href="#PyrN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> which (for their life)</p>
<!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
      <p>They could not let. For both their hearts with equal flame did burn.</p>
      <p>No man was privy to their thoughts. And for to serve their turn,</p>
      <p>Instead of talk they uséd signs: the closelier they suppressed</p>
      <p>The fire of love, the fiercer still it ragéd in their breast.</p>
      <p>The wall that parted house from house had riven therein a cranny,</p>
      <p>Which shrunk at making of the wall: this fault not marked of any</p>
      <p>Of many hundred years before (what doth not love espy?)</p>
      <p>These lovers first of all found out, and made a way whereby</p>
      <p>To talk together secretly, and through the same did go</p>
      <p>Their loving whisp'rings very light and safely to and fro.</p>
      <p>Now as at one side Pyramus, and Thisbe on the tother</p>
      <p>Stood often drawing one of them the pleasant breath from other:</p>
      <p>O spiteful wall (said they) why dost thou part us lovers thus?</p>
      <p>What matter were it if that thou permitted both of us</p>
      <p>In arms each other to embrace? or if thou think that this</p>
      <p>Were over-much, yet mightest thou at least make room to kiss.</p>
      <p>And yet thou shalt not find us churls: we think ourselves in debt</p>
      <p>For the same piece of courtesy, in vouching safe<a name="Pyr_2"></a><a href="#PyrN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> to let</p>
<!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
      <p>Our sayings to our friendly ears thus freely come and go.</p>
      <p>Thus having where they stood in vain complainéd of their woe,</p>
      <p>When night drew near they bade adieu, and each gave kisses sweet</p>
      <p>Unto the parget<a name="Pyr_3"></a><a href="#PyrN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> on their side the which did never meet.</p>
      <p>Next morning with her cheerful light had driven the stars aside,</p>
      <p>And Phoebus with his burning beams the dewy grass had dried,</p>
      <p>These lovers at their wonted place by fore-appointment met,</p>
      <p>Where after much complaint and moan they covenanted to get</p>
      <p>Away from such as watchéd them, and in the evening late</p>
      <p>To steal out of their fathers' house and eke the city gate.</p>
      <p>And to th' intent that in the fields they strayed not up and down,</p>
      <p>They did agree at Ninus' tomb to meet without the town,</p>
      <p>And tarry underneath a tree that by the same did grow;</p>
      <p>Which was a fair high mulberry with fruit as white as snow,</p>
      <p>Hard by a cool and trickling spring. This bargain pleased them both,</p>
      <p>And so daylight (which to their thought away but slowly go'th)</p>
      <p>Did in the Ocean fall to rest, and night from thence doth rise.</p>
      <p>As soon as darkness once was come, straight Thisbe did devise</p>
<!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
      <p>A shift to wind her out of doors, that none that were within</p>
      <p>Perceivéd her; and muffling her with clothes about her chin,</p>
      <p>That no man might discern her face, to Ninus' tomb she came</p>
      <p>Unto the tree, and set her down there underneath the same.</p>
      <p>Love made her bold. But see the chance, there comes besmeared with blood</p>
      <p>About the chaps, a lioness all foaming from the wood,</p>
      <p>From slaughter lately made of kine to staunch her bloody thirst</p>
      <p>With water of the foresaid spring. Whom Thisbe, spying first</p>
      <p>Afar by moonlight, thereupon with fearful steps gan fly</p>
      <p>And in a dark and irksome cave did hide herself thereby.</p>
      <p>And as she fled away for haste she let her mantle fall,</p>
      <p>The which for fear she left behind not looking back at all.</p>
      <p>Now when the cruel lioness her thirst had staunchéd well,</p>
      <p>In going to the wood she found the slender weed that fell</p>
      <p>From Thisbe, which with bloody teeth in pieces she did tear.</p>
      <p>The night was somewhat further spent ere Pyramus came there.</p>
      <p>Who seeing in this subtle sand the print of lion's paw,</p>
      <p>Waxed pale for fear. But when that he the bloody mantle saw</p>
      <p>All rent and torn; one night (he said) shall lovers two confound,</p>
      <p>Of which long life deservèd she of all that live on ground.</p>
<!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
      <p>My soul deserves of this mischance the peril for to bear.</p>
      <p>I, wretch, have been the death of thee, which to this place of fear</p>
      <p>Did cause thee in the night to come, and came not here before.</p>
      <p>My wicked limbs and wretched guts with cruel teeth therefore</p>
      <p>Devour ye, O ye lions all that in this rock do dwell.</p>
      <p>But cowards use to wish for death. The slender weed that fell</p>
      <p>From Thisbe up he takes, and straight doth bear it to the tree,</p>
      <p>Which was appointed erst the place of meeting for to be.</p>
      <p>And when he had bewept and kissed the garment which he knew,</p>
      <p>Receive thou my blood too (quoth he), and therewithal he drew</p>
      <p>His sword, the which among his guts he thrust, and by and by</p>
      <p>Did draw it from the bleeding wound, beginning for to die,</p>
      <p>And cast himself upon his back. The blood did spin on high</p>
      <p>As when a conduit pipe is cracked, the water bursting out</p>
      <p>Doth shoot itself a great way off, and pierce the air about.</p>
      <p>The leaves that were upon the tree besprinkled with his blood</p>
      <p>Were dyéd black. The root also, bestained as it stood</p>
<!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
      <p>A deep dark purple colour, straight upon the berries cast,</p>
      <p>Anon scarce ridded of her fear with which she was aghast,</p>
      <p>For doubt of disappointing him comes Thisbe forth in haste,</p>
      <p>And for her lover looks about, rejoicing for to tell</p>
      <p>How hardly she had 'scaped that night the danger that befell.</p>
      <p>And as she knew right well the place and fashion of the tree</p>
      <p>(As which she saw so late before) even so when she did see</p>
      <p>The colour of the berries turned, she was uncertain whether</p>
      <p>It were the tree at which they both agreed to meet together.</p>
      <p>While in this doubtful stound<a name="Pyr_4"></a><a href="#PyrN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> she stood, she cast her eye aside,</p>
      <p>And there beweltered in his blood her lover she espied</p>
      <p>Lie sprawling with his dying limbs; at which she started back,</p>
      <p>And lookéd pale as any box; a shuddering through her strack,</p>
      <p>Even like the sea which suddenly with whissing noise doth move,</p>
      <p>When with a little blast of wind it is but touched above.</p>
      <p>But when approaching nearer him she knew it was her love,</p>
      <p>She beat her breast, she shriekéd out, she tare her golden hairs,</p>
      <p>And taking him between her arms did wash his wounds with tears;</p>
<!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
      <p>She meint<a name="Pyr_5"></a><a href="#PyrN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> her weeping with his blood, and kissing all his face</p>
      <p>(Which now became as cold as ice) she cried in woeful case:</p>
      <p>Alas! what chance, my Pyramus hath parted thee and me?</p>
      <p>Make answer, O my Pyramus: it is thy Thisbe, even she</p>
      <p>Whom thou dost love most heartily that speaketh unto thee:</p>
      <p>Give ear and raise thy heavy head. He, hearing Thisbe's name,</p>
      <p>Lift up his dying eyes, and, having seen her, closed the same.</p>
      <p>But when she knew her mantle there, and saw his scabbard lie</p>
      <p>Without the sword: Unhappy man, thy love had made thee die;</p>
      <p>Thy love (she said) hath made thee slay thyself. This hand of mine</p>
      <p>Is strong enough to do the like. My love no less than thine</p>
      <p>Shall give me force to work my wound.  I will pursue thee dead,</p>
      <p>And, wretched woman as I am, it shall of me be said,</p>
      <p>That like as of thy death I was the only cause and blame,</p>
      <p>So am I thy companion eke and partner in the same.</p>
      <p>For death which only could, alas! asunder part us twain,</p>
      <p>Shall never so dissever us but we will meet again.</p>
      <p>And you the parents of us both, most wretched folk alive,</p>
      <p>Let this request that I shall make in both our names belyve<a name="Pyr_6"></a><a href="#PyrN_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
<!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
      <p>Entreat you to permit that we, whom chaste and steadfast love,</p>
      <p>And whom even death hath joined in one, may, as it doth behove,</p>
      <p>In one grave be together laid. And thou unhappy tree,</p>
      <p>Which shroudest now the corse of one, and shalt anon through me</p>
      <p>Shroud two, of this same slaughter hold the sicker<a name="Pyr_7"></a><a href="#PyrN_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> signs for ay</p>
      <p>Black be the colour of thy fruit and mourning-like alway,</p>
      <p>Such as the murder of us twain may evermore bewray.</p>
      <p>This said, she took the sword, yet warm with slaughter of her love,</p>
      <p>And setting it beneath her breast did to the heart it shove.</p>
      <p>Her prayer with the gods and with their parents took effect,</p>
      <p>For when the fruit is throughly ripe, the berry is bespect<a name="Pyr_8"></a><a href="#PyrN_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>
      <p>With colour tending to a black. And that which after fire</p>

<h3>ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW; HIS MAD
PRANKS AND MERRY JESTS</h3>

  <p>Not omitting that ancient form of beginning tales, <i>Once upon a
  time</i> it was my chance to travel into that noble county of Kent. The
  weather being wet, and my two-legged horse being almost tired (for indeed
  my own legs were all the supporters that my body had), I went dropping
  into an alehouse; there found I, first a kind welcome, next good liquor,
  then kind strangers (which made good company), then an honest host, whose
  love to good liquor was written in red characters both in his nose,
  cheeks and forehead: an hostess I found there too, a woman of very good
  carriage; and though she had not so much colour (for what she had done)
  as her rich husband had, yet all beholders might perceive by the
  roundness of her belly, that she was able to draw a pot dry at a draught,
  and ne'er unlace for the matter.</p>

  <p>Well, to the fire I went, where I dried my outside and wet my inside.
  The ale being good, and I in good company, I lapt in so much of this
  nappy liquor, that it begot in me a boldness to talk, and desire of them
  to know what was the reason that the people of that country were called
  Long-tails<a name="Rob_1"></a><a href="#RobN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The
  host said, all the reason that ever he <!-- Page 82 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82"></a>[82]</span> could hear was, because
  the people of that country formerly did use to go in side-skirted coats.
  "There is," said an old man that sat by, "another reason that I have
  heard: that is this. In the time of the Saxons' conquest of England there
  were divers of our countrymen slain by treachery, which made those that
  survived more careful in dealing with their enemies, as you shall
  hear.</p>

  <p>"After many overthrows that our countrymen had received by the Saxons,
  they dispersed themselves into divers companies into the woods, and so
  did much damage by their sudden assaults to the Saxons, that Hengist,
  their king, hearing the damage that they did (and not knowing how to
  subdue them by force), used this policy. He sent to a company of them,
  and gave them his word for their liberty and safe return, if they would
  come unarmed and speak with him. This they seemed to grant unto, but for
  their more security (knowing how little he esteemed oaths or promises)
  they went every one of them armed with a short sword, hanging just behind
  under their garments, so that the Saxons thought not of any weapons they
  had: but it proved otherwise; for when Hengist his men (that were placed
  to cut them off) fell all upon them, they found such unlooked a
  resistance, that most of the Saxons were slain, and they that escaped,
  wondering how they could do that hurt, having no weapons (as they saw),
  reported that they struck down men like lions with their tails; and so
  they ever after were called Kentish Long-tails."</p>

<!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
I told him this was strange, if true, and that their country's
honour bound them more to believe in this than it did me.

  <p>"Truly, sir," said my hostess, "I think we are called Long-tails, by
  reason our tales are long, that we used to pass the time withal, and make
  ourselves merry." "Now, good hostess," said I, "let me entreat from you
  one of those tales." "You shall," said she, "and that shall not be a
  common one neither, for it is a long tale, a merry tale, and a sweet
  tale; and thus it begins."</p>

<p class="center">THE HOSTESS'S TALE OF THE BIRTH OF ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, a great while ago, when men did eat more and drink
  less&mdash;then men were more honest, that knew no knavery, than some now
  are that confess the knowledge and deny the practice&mdash;about that
  time (whensoe'er it was) there was wont to walk many harmless spirits
  called fairies, dancing in brave order in fairy rings on green hills with
  sweet music (sometime invisible) in divers shapes: many mad pranks would
  they play, as pinching of sluts black and blue, and misplacing things in
  ill-ordered houses; but lovingly would they use wenches that cleanly
  were, giving them silver and other pretty toys, which they would leave
  for them, sometimes in their shoes, other times in their pockets,
  sometimes in bright basins and other clean vessels.</p>

  <p>Amongst these fairies was there a he-fairy; whether he was their king
  or no I know not, but surely he had great <!-- Page 84 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84"></a>[84]</span> government and command
  in that country, as you shall hear. This same he-fairy did love a proper
  young wench, for every night would he with other fairies come to the
  house, and there dance in her chamber; and oftentimes she was forced to
  dance with him, and at his departure would he leave her silver and
  jewels, to express his love unto her. At last this maid was with child,
  and being asked who was the father of it, she answered a man that nightly
  came to visit her, but early in the morning he would go his way, whither
  she knew not, he went so suddenly.</p>

  <p>Many old women, that then had more wit than those that are now living
  and have less, said that a fairy had gotten her with child; and they bid
  her be of good comfort, for the child must needs be fortunate that had so
  noble a father as a fairy was, and should work many strange wonders. To
  be short, her time grew on, and she was delivered of a man child, who (it
  should seem) so rejoiced his father's heart, that every night his mother
  was supplied with necessary things that are befitting a woman in
  child-birth, so that in no mean manner neither; for there had she rich
  embroidered cushions, stools, carpets, coverlets, delicate linen: then
  for meat she had capons, chickens, mutton, lamb, pheasant, snite<a
  name="Rob_2"></a><a href="#RobN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, woodcock,
  partridge, quail. The gossips liked this fare so well that she never
  wanted company; wine had she of all sorts, muskadine, sack, malmsey,
  claret, white and bastard; this pleased her neighbours well, so that few
  that came to see her, but they had home with them a medicine for the
  fleas. <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_85"></a>[85]</span> Sweetmeats too had they in such abundance
  that some of their teeth are rotten to this day; and for music she wanted
  not, or any other thing she desired.</p>

  <p>All praised this honest fairy for his care, and the child for his
  beauty, and the mother for a happy woman. In brief, christened he was, at
  the which all this good cheer was doubled, which made most of the women
  so wise, that they forgot to make themselves unready, and so lay in their
  clothes; and none of them next day could remember the child's name but
  the clerk, and he may thank his book for it, or else it had been utterly
  lost. So much for the birth of little Robin.</p>

<p class="center">OF ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW'S BEHAVIOUR WHEN HE WAS YOUNG</p>

  <p>When Robin was grown to six years of age, he was so knavish that all
  the neighbours did complain of him; for no sooner was his mother's back
  turned, but he was in one knavish action or other, so that his mother was
  constrained (to avoid the complaints) to take him with her to market, or
  wheresoever she went or rode. But this helped little or nothing, for if
  he rode before her, then would he make mouths and ill-favoured faces at
  those he met; if he rode behind her, then would he clap his hand on his
  tail; so that his mother was weary of the many complaints that came
  against him, yet knew she not how to beat him justly for it, because she
  never saw him do that which was worthy blows. The complaints were daily
  so renewed that his mother promised <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86"></a>[86]</span> him a whipping. Robin
  did not like that cheer, and therefore, to avoid it, he ran away, and
  left his mother a heavy woman for him.</p>

<p class="center">HOW ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW DWELT WITH A TAILOR</p>

  <p>After that Robin Good-fellow had gone a great way from his mother's
  house, he began to be hungry, and going to a tailor's house, he asked
  something for God's sake. The tailor gave him meat, and understanding
  that he was masterless, he took him for his man, and Robin so plied his
  work that he got his master's love.</p>

  <p>On a time his master had a gown to make for a woman, and it was to be
  done that night: they both sat up late so that they had done all but
  setting on the sleeves by twelve o'clock. This master then being sleepy
  said, "Robin, whip thou on the sleeves, and then come thou to bed; I will
  go to bed before." "I will," said Robin. So soon as his master was gone,
  Robin hung up the gown, and taking both sleeves in his hands, he whipped
  and lashed them on the gown. So stood he till the morning that his master
  came down: his master seeing him stand in that fashion asked him what he
  did? "Why," quoth he, "as you bid me, whip on the sleeves." "Thou rogue,"
  said his master, "I did mean that thou shouldst have set them on quickly
  and slightly." "I would you had said so," said Robin, "for then had I not
  lost all this sleep." To be short, his master <!-- Page 87 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87"></a>[87]</span> was fain to do the
  work, but ere he had made an end of it, the woman came for it, and with a
  loud voice chafed for her gown. The tailor, thinking to please her, bid
  Robin fetch the remnants that they left yesterday (meaning thereby meat
  that was left); but Robin, to cross his master the more, brought down the
  remnants of the cloth that was left of the gown. At the sight of this,
  his master looked pale, but the woman was glad, saying, "I like this
  breakfast so well, that I will give you a pint of wine to it." She sent
  Robin for the wine, but he never returned again to his master.</p>

<p class="center">WHAT HAPPENED TO ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW AFTER HE
WENT FROM THE TAILOR</p>

  <p>After Robin had travelled a good day's journey from his master's house
  he sat down, and being weary he fell asleep. No sooner had slumber taken
  full possession of him, and closed his long-opened eyelids, but he
  thought he saw many goodly proper personages in antic measures tripping
  about him, and withal he heard such music as he thought that Orpheus,
  that famous Greek fiddler (had he been alive), compared to one of these,
  had been as infamous as a Welsh harper that plays for cheese and onions.
  As delights commonly last not long, so did those end sooner than he would
  willingly they should have done; and for very grief he awaked, and found
  by him lying a scroll, wherein was written these lines following in
  golden letters. <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Robin having read this was very joyful, yet longed he to know whether
  he had this power or not, and to try it he wished for some meat:
  presently<a name="Rob_3"></a><a href="#RobN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> it was
  before him. Then wished he for beer and wine: he straightway had it. This
  liked him well, and because he was weary, he wished himself a horse: no
  sooner was his wish ended, but he was transformed, and seemed a horse of
  twenty pound price, and leaped and curveted as nimble as if he had been
  in stable at rack and manger a good month. Then wished he himself a dog,
  and was so: then a tree, and was so: so from one <!-- Page 89 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89"></a>[89]</span> thing to another, till
  he was certain and well assured that he could change himself to any thing
  whatsoever.</p>

<p class="center">HOW ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW SERVED A CLOWNISH FELLOW</p>

  <p>Robin Good-fellow going over a field met with a clownish fellow, to
  whom he spake in this manner. "Friend," quoth he, "what is a clock?" "A
  thing," answered the clown, "that shows the time of the day." "Why then,"
  said Robin Good-fellow, "be thou a clock, and tell me what time of the
  day it is." "I owe thee not so much service," answered he again, "but
  because thou shalt think thyself beholden to me, know that it is the same
  time of the day as it was yesterday at this time."</p>

  <p>These cross-answers vexed Robin Good-fellow, so that in himself he
  vowed to be revenged of him, which he did in this manner.</p>

  <p>Robin Good-fellow turned himself into a bird, and followed this
  fellow, who was going into a field a little from that place to catch a
  horse that was at grass. The horse being wild ran over dyke and hedge,
  and the fellow after; but to little purpose, for the horse was too swift
  for him. Robin was glad of this occasion, for now or never was the time
  to put his revenge in action.</p>

  <p>Presently Robin shaped himself like to the horse that the fellow
  followed, and so stood before the fellow: presently the fellow took hold
  of him and got on his back, but long <!-- Page 90 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90"></a>[90]</span> had he not rid, but
  with a stumble he hurled this churlish clown to the ground, that he
  almost broke his neck; yet took he not this for a sufficient revenge for
  the cross-answers he had received, but stood still and let the fellow
  mount him once more.</p>

  <p>In the way the fellow was to ride was a great plash of water of a good
  depth: through this must he of necessity ride. No sooner was he in the
  midst of it, but Robin Good-fellow left him with nothing but a
  pack-saddle betwixt his legs, and in the shape of a fish swam to the
  shore, and ran away laughing, <i>ho, ho, hoh!</i><a name="Rob_4"></a><a
  href="#RobN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> leaving the poor fellow almost
  drowned.</p>

<p class="center">HOW ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW HELPED TWO LOVERS AND
DECEIVED AN OLD MAN</p>

  <p>Robin going by a wood heard two lovers make great lamentation, because
  they were hindered from enjoying each other by a cruel old lecher, who
  would not suffer this loving couple to marry. Robin, pitying them, went
  to them and said: "I have heard your complaints, and do pity you; be
  ruled by me, and I will see that you shall have both your hearts'
  content, and that suddenly if you please." After some amazement the
  maiden said, "Alas! sir, how can that be? My uncle, because I will not
  grant to his lust, is so straight over me, and so oppresseth me with work
  night and day, that I have not so much time as to drink or speak with
  <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
  this young man, whom I love above all men living." "If your work be all
  that hindereth you," said Robin, "I will see that done: ask me not how,
  nor make any doubt of the performance; I will do it. Go you with your
  love: for twenty-four hours I will free you. In that time marry or do
  what you will. If you refuse my proffered kindness never look to enjoy
  your wished-for happiness. I love true lovers, honest men, good fellows,
  good housewives, good meat, good drink, and all things that good is, but
  nothing that is ill; for my name is Robin Good-fellow, and that you shall
  see that I have power to perform what I have undertaken, see what I can
  do." Presently he turned himself into a horse, and away he ran: at the
  sight of which they were both amazed, but better considering with
  themselves, they both determined to make good use of their time, and
  presently they went to an old friar, who presently married them. They
  paid him, and went their way. Where they supped and lay, I know not, but
  surely they liked their lodging well the next day.</p>

  <p>Robin, when that he came near the old man's house, turned himself into
  the shape of the young maid, and entered the house, where, after much
  chiding, he fell to the work that the maid had to do, which he did in
  half the time that another could do it in. The old man, seeing the speed
  he made, thought that she had some meeting that night (for he took Robin
  Good-fellow for his niece); therefore he gave him order for other work,
  that was too much for any <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_92"></a>[92]</span> one to do in one night; Robin did that in
  a trice, and played many mad pranks beside ere the day appeared.</p>

  <p>In the morning he went to the two lovers to their bed-side, and bid
  God give them joy, and told them all things went well, and that ere night
  he would bring them ten pounds of her uncle's to begin the world with.
  They both thanked him, which was all the requital that he looked for, and
  being therewith well contented he went his way laughing.</p>

  <p>Home went he to the old man, who then was by, and marvelled how the
  work was done so soon. Robin, seeing that, said: "Sir, I pray marvel not,
  for a greater wonder than that this night hath happened to me." "Good
  niece, what is that?" said the old man. "This, Sir; but I shame to speak
  it, yet I will: weary with work, I slept, and did dream that I consented
  to that which you have so often desired of me (you know what it is I
  mean), and methought you gave me as a reward ten pounds, with your
  consent to marry that young man that I have loved so long." "Didst thou
  dream so? thy dream I will make good, for under my handwriting I give my
  free consent to marry him, or whom thou dost please to marry (and withal
  writ); and for the ten pounds, go but into the out-barn, and I will bring
  it thee presently. How sayest thou," said the old lecher; "wilt thou?"
  Robin with silence did seem to grant, and went toward the barn. The old
  man made haste, told out his money, and followed. <!-- Page 93 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

  <p>Being come thither, he hurled the money on the ground, saying, "This
  is the most pleasing bargain that ever I made;" and going to embrace
  Robin, Robin took him up in his arms and carried him forth; first drew
  him through a pond to cool his hot blood, then did he carry him where the
  young married couple were, and said, "Here is your uncle's consent under
  his hand; then, here is the ten pounds he gave you, and there is your
  uncle: let him deny it if he can."</p>

  <p>The old man, for fear of worse usage, said all was true. "Then am I as
  good as my word," said Robin, and so went, away laughing. The old man
  knew himself duly punished, and turned his hatred into love, and thought
  afterward as well of them as if she had been his own. The second part
  shall show many incredible things done by Robin Good-fellow (or otherwise
  called Hob-goblin) and his companions, by turning himself into divers
  sundry shapes.</p>

<h3>THE SECOND PART OF ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW,
COMMONLY CALLED HOB-GOBLIN</h3>

<p class="center">HOW ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW HELPED A MAID TO WORK</p>

  <p>Robin Good-fellow oftentimes would in the night visit farmers' houses,
  and help the maids to break hemp, to bolt<a name="Rob_5"></a><a
  href="#RobN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, to dress flax, and to spin and do
  other work, for he was <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_94"></a>[94]</span> excellent in everything. One night he came
  to a farmer's house, where there was a good handsome maid: this maid
  having much work to do, Robin one night did help her, and in six hours
  did bolt more than she could have done in twelve hours. The maid wondered
  the next day how her work came, and to know the doer, she watched the
  next night that did follow. About twelve of the clock in came Robin, and
  fell to breaking of hemp, and for to delight himself he sung this mad
  song.</p>

<!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>

  <p>The maid, seeing him bare in clothes, pitied him, and against the next
  night provided him a waistcoat. Robin, coming the next night to work, as
  he did before, espied the waistcoat, whereat he started and
  said&mdash;</p>

  </div>
  <p>So went he away laughing, <i>ho, ho, hoh!</i> The maid was much
  grieved and discontented at his anger: for ever after she was fain to do
  her work herself without the help of Robin Good-fellow.</p>

<p class="center">HOW ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW LED A COMPANY OF FELLOWS OUT
OF THEIR WAY</p>

  <p>A company of young men having been making merry with their
  sweethearts, were at their coming home to come over a heath. Robin
  Good-fellow, knowing of it, met them, and to make some pastime, he led
  them up and down the heath a whole night, so that they could not get out
  of it; for he went before them in the shape of a walking fire, which they
  all saw and followed till the day did appear: then Robin left them, and
  at his departure spake these words&mdash; <!-- Page 96 --><span

  <p>The fellows were glad that he was gone, for they were all in a great
  fear that he would have done them some mischief.</p>

<p class="center">HOW ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW SERVED A LECHEROUS GALLANT</p>

  <p>Robin always did help those that suffered wrong, and never would hurt
  any but those that did wrong to others. It was his chance one day to go
  through a field where he heard one call for help: he, going near where he
  heard the cry, saw a lusty gallant that would have forced a young maiden
  to his lust; but the maiden in no wise would yield, which made her cry
  for help. Robin Good-fellow, seeing of this, turned himself into the
  shape of a hare, and so ran between the lustful gallant's legs. This
  gallant, thinking to have taken him, he presently turned himself into a
  horse, and so perforce carried away this gallant on his back. The
  gentleman cried out for help, for he thought that the devil had been come
  to fetch him for his wickedness; but his crying was in vain, for Robin
  did carry him into a thick hedge, and there left him <!-- Page 97
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97"></a>[97]</span> so pricked and
  scratched, that he more desired a plaister for his pain than a wench for
  his pleasure. Thus the poor maid was freed from this ruffian, and Robin
  Good-fellow, to see this gallant so tame, went away laughing, <i>ho, ho,
  hoh!</i></p>

<p class="center">HOW ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW TURNED A MISERABLE USURER TO A
GOOD HOUSE-KEEPER</p>

  <p>In this country of ours there was a rich man dwelled, who to get
  wealth together was so sparing that he could not find in his heart to
  give his belly food enough. In the winter he never would make so much
  fire as would roast a black-pudding, for he found it more profitable to
  sit by other men's. His apparel was of the fashion that none did wear;
  for it was such as did hang at a broker's stall, till it was as
  weather-beaten as an old sign. This man for his covetousness was so hated
  of all his neighbours, that there was not one that gave him a good word.
  Robin Good-fellow grieved to see a man of such wealth do so little good,
  and therefore practised to better him in this manner.</p>

  <p>One night the usurer being in bed, Robin in the shape of a
  night-raven<a name="Rob_7"></a><a href="#RobN_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> came
  to the window, and there did beat with his wings, and croaked in such
  manner that this old usurer thought he should have presently died for
  fear. This was but a preparation to what he did intend; for presently
  after he appeared before him at his bed's feet, in the shape of a ghost,
  with a torch in his hand. At the sight of this the old <!-- Page 98
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98"></a>[98]</span> usurer would
  have risen out of his bed, and have leaped out of the window, but he was
  stayed by Robin Good-fellow, who spake to him thus&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>If thou dost stir out of thy bed,</p>
      <p>I do vow to strike thee dead.</p>
      <p>I do come to do thee good;</p>
      <p>Recall thy wits and starkled<a name="Rob_8"></a><a href="#RobN_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> blood.</p>
      <p>The money which thou up dost store</p>
      <p>In soul and body makes thee poor.</p>
      <p>Do good with money while you may;</p>
      <p>Thou hast not long on earth to stay.</p>
      <p>Do good, I say, or day and night</p>
      <p>I hourly thus will thee affright.</p>
      <p>Think on my words, and so farewell,</p>
      <p>For being bad I live in hell.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Having said thus he vanished away and left this usurer in great terror
  of mind; and for fear of being frighted again with this ghost, he turned
  very liberal, and lived amongst his neighbours as an honest man should
  do.</p>

  a-winding of quills<a name="Rob_9"></a><a

  well, that for her sake he became servant to her husband, and did daily
  work at the loom; but all the kindness that he showed was but lost, for
  his mistress would show him no favour, which made him <!-- Page 99
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99"></a>[99]</span> many times to
  exclaim against the whole sex in satirical songs; and one day being at

  <p>Moved with this song and other complaints of his, she at last did
  fancy him, so that the weaver did not like that Robin should be so saucy
  with his wife, and therefore gave him warning to be gone, for he would
  keep him no longer. This grieved this loving couple to part one from the
  other, which made them to make use of the time that they had. The weaver
  one day coming in, found them a-kissing: at this he said [nothing] but
  vowed in himself to be revenged of his man that night following. Night
  being come, the weaver went to Robin's bed, and took him out of it (as he
  then thought) and ran apace to the river side to hurl Robin in; but the
  weaver was deceived, for Robin, instead of himself, had laid in his bed a
  sack full of yarn: it was that that the weaver carried to drown. The
  weaver standing by the river side said:&mdash;Now will I cool your hot
  blood, Master Robert, and if you cannot swim the better you shall sink
  and drown, With that he hurled the sack in, thinking that it had been
  Robin Good-fellow. Robin, standing behind him, said&mdash;</p>

  <p>They all liked his song very well, and said that the young man had but
  ill-luck. Thus continued he playing and singing songs till candle-light:
  then he began to play his merry tricks in this manner. First he put out
  the candles, and then, being dark, he struck the men good boxes on the
  ears: they, thinking it had been those that did sit next them, fell
  a-fighting one with the other; so that there was not one of them but had
  either a broken head or a bloody nose. At this Robin laughed heartily.
  The women did not escape him, for the handsomest he kissed; the other he
  pinched, and made them scratch one the other, as if they had been cats.
  Candles being lighted again, they all were friends, and fell again to
  dancing, and after to supper. <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

  <p>Supper being ended, a great posset was brought forth: at this Robin
  Good-fellow's teeth did water, for it looked so lovely that he could not
  keep from it. To attain to his wish, he did turn himself into a bear:
  both men and women (seeing a bear amongst them) ran away, and left the
  whole posset to Robin Good-fellow. He quickly made an end of it, and went
  away without his money; for the sport he had was better to him than any
  money whatsoever. The fear that the guests were in did cause such a
  smell, that the bridegroom did call for perfumes; and instead of a
  posset, he was fain to make use of cold beer.</p>

<p class="center">HOW ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW SERVED A TAPSTER FOR
NICKING HIS POTS</p>

  <p>There was a tapster, that with his pots' smallness, and with frothing
  of his drink, had got a good sum of money together. This nicking of the
  pots he would never leave, yet divers times he had been under the hand of
  authority, but what money soever he had [to pay] for his abuses, he would
  be sure (as they all do) to get it out of the poor man's pot again. Robin
  Good-fellow, hating such knavery, put a trick upon him in this
  manner.</p>

  <p>Robin shaped himself like to the tapster's brewer, and came and
  demanded twenty pounds which was due to him from the tapster. The
  tapster, thinking it had been his brewer, paid him the money, which money
  Robin gave to the <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_105"></a>[105]</span> poor of that parish before the tapster's
  face. The tapster praised his charity very much, and said that God would
  bless him the better for such good deeds: so after they had drank one
  with the other, they parted.</p>

  <p>Some four days after the brewer himself came for his money: the
  tapster told him that it was paid, and that he had a quittance from him
  to show. Hereat the brewer did wonder, and desired to see the quittance.
  The tapster fetched him a writing, which Robin Good-fellow had given him
  instead of a quittance, wherein was written as followeth, which the
  brewer read to him&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>I, Robin Good-fellow, true man and honest man, do acknowledge to have
  received of Nick and Froth, the cheating tapster, the sum of twenty
  pounds, which money I have bestowed (to the tapster's content) among the
  poor of the parish, out of whose pockets this aforesaid tapster had
  picked the aforesaid sum, not after the manner of foisting, but after his
  excellent skill of bombasting<a name="Rob_11"></a><a
  href="#RobN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>, or a pint for a penny.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <p class="i2">Then take thy apron strings;</p>

      <p class="i2">Upon the gallows sings.</p>
      <p class="i16"><i>Per me</i> ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At this the tapster swore Walsingham; but for all his swearing, the
  brewer made him pay him his twenty pounds. <!-- Page 106 --><span

<p class="center">HOW KING OBREON<a name="Rob_12"></a><a href="#RobN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> CALLED ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW
TO DANCE</p>

  <p>King Obreon, seeing Robin Good-fellow do so many honest and merry
  tricks, called him one night out of his bed with these words,
  saying&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Robin, my son, come quickly, rise:</p>
      <p>First stretch, then yawn, and rub your eyes;</p>
      <p>For thou must go with me to-night,</p>
      <p>To see, and taste of my delight.</p>
      <p>Quickly come, my wanton son;</p>
      <p>'Twere time our sports were now begun.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Robin, hearing this, rose and went to him. There were with King Obreon
  a many fairies, all attired in green silk; all these, with King Obreon,
  did welcome Robin Good-fellow into their company. Obreon took Robin by
  the hand and led him a dance: their musician was little Tom Thumb; for he
  had an excellent bag-pipe made of a wren's quill, and the skin of a
  Greenland louse: this pipe was so shrill, and so sweet, that a Scottish
  pipe compared to it, it would no more come near it, than a Jew's-trump
  doth to an Irish harp. After they had danced, King Obreon spake to his
  son, Robin Good-fellow, in this manner&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>When e'er you hear my piper blow,</p>
      <p>From thy bed see that thou go;</p>
      <p>For nightly you must with us dance,</p>
      <p>When we in circles round do prance.</p>
<!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
      <p>I love thee, son, and by the hand</p>
      <p>I carry thee to Fairy Land,</p>
      <p>Where thou shalt see what no man knows:</p>
      <p>Such love thee King Obreon owes.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>So marched they in good manner (with their piper before) to the Fairy
  Land: there did King Obreon show Robin Good-fellow many secrets, which he
  never did open to the world.</p>

<p class="center">HOW ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW WAS WONT TO WALK
IN THE NIGHT</p>

  <p>Robin Good-fellow would many times walk in the night with a broom on
  his shoulder, and cry "chimney sweep," but when any one did call him,
  then would he run away laughing <i>ho, ho, hoh!</i> Sometimes he would
  counterfeit a beggar, begging very pitifully, but when they came to give
  him an alms, he would run away, laughing as his manner was. Sometimes
  would he knock at men's doors, and when the servants came, he would blow
  out the candle, if they were men; but if they were women, he would not
  only put out their light, but kiss them full sweetly, and then go away as
  his fashion was, <i>ho, ho, hoh!</i> Oftentimes would he sing at a door
  like a singing man, and when they did come to give him his reward, he
  would turn his back and laugh. In these humours of his he had many pretty
  songs, which I will sing as perfect as I can. For his chimney-sweeper's
  humours he <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_108"></a>[108]</span> had these songs: the first is to the
  tune of <i>I have been a fiddler these fifteen years</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>Then maidens, come and cherish him</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Horns have I store, but all at my back;</p>
      <p>My head no ornament doth lack:</p>
      <p>I give my horns to other men,</p>
      <p>And ne'er require them again.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Then come away, you wanton wives,</p>
      <p>That love your pleasures as your lives:</p>
      <p>To each good woman I'll give two,</p>
      <p>Or more, if she think them too few.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Then would he change his note and sing this following, to the tune of

  <p>Thus danced they a good space: at last they left and sat down upon the
  grass; and to requite Robin Good-fellow's kindness, they promised to tell
  to him all the exploits that they were accustomed to do: Robin thanked
  them and listened to them, and one began to tell his tricks in this
  manner.</p>

<p class="center">THE TRICKS OF THE FAIRY CALLED PINCH</p>

  <p>"After that we have danced in this manner as you have beheld, I, that
  am called Pinch, do go about from house to house: sometimes I find the
  doors of the house open; that negligent servant that left them so, I do
  so nip him or her, that with my pinches their bodies are as many colours
  as a <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_116"></a>[116]</span> mackerel's back. Then take I them, and
  lay I them in the door, naked or unnaked I care not whether: there they
  lie, many times till broad day, ere they waken; and many times, against
  their wills, they show some parts about them, that they would not have
  openly seen.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I find a slut sleeping in the chimney-corner, when she
  should be washing of her dishes, or doing something else which she hath
  left undone: her I pinch about the arms, for not laying her arms to her
  labour. Some I find in their bed snorting and sleeping, and their houses
  lying as clean as a nasty dog's kennel; in one corner bones, in another
  egg-shells, behind the door a heap of dust, the dishes under feet, and
  the cat in the cupboard: all these sluttish tricks I do reward with blue
  legs, and blue arms. I find some slovens too, as well as sluts: they pay
  for their beastliness too, as well as the women-kind; for if they uncase
  a sloven and not untie their points, I so pay their arms that they cannot
  sometimes untie them, if they would. Those that leave foul shoes, or go
  into their beds with their stockings on, I use them as I did the former,
  and never leave them till they have left their beastliness.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>But to the good I do no harm,</p>
      <p>But cover them and keep them warm:</p>
      <p>Sluts and slovens I do pinch,</p>
      <p>And make them in their beds to winch</p>
      <p>This is my practice, and my trade;</p>
      <p>Many have I cleanly made."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>

<p class="center">THE TRICKS OF THE FAIRY CALLED PATCH</p>

  <p>"About midnight do I walk, and for the tricks I play they call me
  Patch. When I find a slut asleep, I smutch her face if it be clean; but
  if it be dirty, I wash it in the next piss pot that I can find: the balls
  I use to wash such sluts withal is a sow's pancake or a pilgrim's salve.
  Those that I find with their heads nitty and scabby, for want of combing,
  I am their barbers, and cut their hair as close as an ape's tail; or else
  clap so much pitch on it, that they must cut it off themselves to their
  great shame. Slovens also that neglect their masters' business, they do
  not escape. Some I find that spoil their masters' horses for want of
  currying: those I do daub with grease and soot, that they are fain to
  curry themselves ere they can get clean. Others that for laziness will
  give the poor beasts no meat, I oftentimes so punish them with blows,
  that they cannot feed themselves they are so sore.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Thus many tricks I Patch can do,</p>
      <p>But to the good I ne'er was foe:</p>
      <p>The bad I hate and will do ever,</p>
      <p>Till they from ill themselves do sever.</p>
      <p>To help the good I'll run and go,</p>
      <p>The bad no good from me shall know."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p class="center">THE TRICKS OF THE FAIRY CALLED GULL</p>

  <p>"When mortals keep their beds I walk abroad, and for my pranks am
  called by the name of Gull. I with a feigned <!-- Page 118 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118"></a>[118]</span> voice do often
  deceive many men, to their great amazement. Many times I get on men and
  women, and so lie on their stomachs, that I cause there great pain, for
  which they call me by the name of Hag, or Nightmare. 'Tis I that do steal
  children, and in the place of them leave changelings. Sometimes I also
  steal milk and cream, and then with my brothers, Patch, Pinch, and Grim,
  and sisters Sib, Tib, Lick, and Lull, I feast with my stolen goods: our
  little piper hath his share in all our spoils, but he nor our women
  fairies do ever put themselves in danger to do any great exploit.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>What Gull can do, I have you shown;</p>
      <p>I am inferior unto none.</p>
      <p>Command me, Robin, thou shalt know,</p>
      <p>That I for thee will ride or go:</p>
      <p>I can do greater things than these</p>
      <p>Upon the land, and on the seas."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p class="center">THE TRICKS OF THE FAIRY CALLED GRIM</p>

  <p>"I walk with the owl, and make many to cry as loud as she doth hollo.
  Sometimes I do affright many simple people, for which some have termed me
  the Black Dog of Newgate. At the meetings of young men and maids I many
  times am, and when they are in the midst of all their good cheer, I come
  in, in some fearful shape, and affright them, and then carry away their
  good cheer, and eat it with my fellow fairies. 'Tis I that do, like a
  screech-owl <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_119"></a>[119]</span> cry at sick men's windows, which makes
  the hearers so fearful, that they say, that the sick person cannot live.
  Many other ways have I to fright the simple, but the understanding man I
  cannot move to fear, because he knows I have no power to do hurt.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>My nightly business I have told,</p>
      <p>To play these tricks I use of old:</p>
      <p>When candles burn both blue and dim,</p>
      <p>Old folk will say, Here's fairy Grim.</p>
      <p>More tricks than these I use to do:</p>
      <p>Hereat cried Robin, <i>Ho, ho, hoh!</i>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p class="center">THE TRICKS OF THE WOMEN FAIRIES TOLD BY SIB</p>

  <p>"To walk nightly, as do the men fairies, we use not; but now and then
  we go together, and at good housewives' fires we warm and dress our fairy
  children. If we find clean water and clean towels, we leave them money,
  either in their basins or in their shoes; but if we find no clean water
  in their houses, we wash our children in their pottage, milk, or beer, or
  whate'er we find: for the sluts that leave not such things fitting, we
  wash their faces and hands with a gilded child's clout, or else carry
  them to some river, and duck them over head and ears. We often use to
  dwell in some great hill, and from thence we do lend money to any poor
  man or woman that hath need; but if they bring it not again at the day
  appointed, we do not only punish them with <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120"></a>[120]</span> pinching, but also in
  their goods, so that they never thrive till they have paid us.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Tib and I the chiefest are,</p>
      <p>And for all things do take care.</p>
      <p>Lick is cook and dresseth meat,</p>
      <p>And fetcheth all things that we eat:</p>
      <p>Lull is nurse and tends the cradle,</p>
      <p>And the babes doth dress and swaddle.</p>
      <p>This little fellow, called Tom Thumb,</p>
      <p>That is no bigger than a plum,</p>
      <p>He is the porter to our gate,</p>
      <p>For he doth let all in thereat,</p>
      <p>And makes us merry with his play,</p>
      <p>And merrily we spend the day."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>She having spoken, Tom Thumb stood up on tip-toe and showed himself,
  saying&mdash;</p>

  <p>He had no sooner ended his two lines, but a shepherd (that was
  watching in the field all night) blew up a bag-pipe: this so frightened
  Tom, that he could not tell what to do for the present time. The fairies
  seeing Tom Thumb in such a fear, punished the shepherd with his pipes'
  loss, so that the shepherd's pipe presently brake in his hand, to his
  great amazement. Hereat did Robin Good-fellow laugh, <i>ho, ho, hoh!</i>
  Morning being come, they all hasted to Fairy Land, where I think they yet
  remain. <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>My hostess asked me how I liked this tale? I said, it was long enough,
  and good enough to pass time that might be worser spent. I, seeing her
  dry, called for two pots: she emptied one of them at a draught, and never
  breathed for the matter: I emptied the other at leisure; and being late I
  went to bed, and did dream of this which I had heard.</p>

<h3>REGINALD SCOT</h3>

<p class="center">DISCOVERY OF WITCHCRAFT (1584)</p>

  <p><i>From</i> "To the Readers."</p>

  <p>I should no more prevail herein [<i>i.e.</i> in securing attention]
  than if a hundred years since I should have entreated your predecessors
  to believe, that Robin Goodfellow, that great and ancient bull-beggar,
  had been but a cozening merchant and no devil indeed.... But Robin
  Goodfellow ceaseth now to be much feared, and popery is sufficiently
  discovered.</p>

  <p>Book I, chap. iv.&mdash;"What miraculous actions are imputed to
  witches by witchmongers, papists, and poets."</p>

  <p>[Quoted here to show that certain attributes of Shakespeare's fairies
  belong also to witches.]</p>

  <p>[They] raise hail, tempests, and hurtful weather, as lighting,
  thunder, &amp;c.... These can pass from place to place in the air
  invisible.... These can alter men's minds to inordinate love or hate....
  Ovid affirmeth that they can raise and suppress lighting and thunder,
  rain and hail, clouds and winds, tempests and earthquakes. Others do
  write that they can pull down the moon and the stars.... <!-- Page 134
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134"></a>[134]</span> They can
  also bring to pass, that, churn as long as you list, your butter will not
  come.</p>

  <p>Book III, chap. iv.</p>

  <p>The Fairies do principally inhabit the mountains and caverns of the
  earth, whose nature is to make strange apparitions on the earth, in
  meadows or on mountains, being like men and women, soldiers, kings, and
  ladies, children and horsemen, clothed in green, to which purpose they do
  in the night steal hempen stalks from the fields where they grow, to
  convert them into horses, as the story goes.... Such jocund and facetious
  spirits are said to sport themselves in the night by tumbling and fooling
  with servants and shepherds in country houses, pinching them black and
  blue, and leaving bread, butter, and cheese sometimes with them, which,
  if they refuse to eat, some mischief shall undoubtedly befall them by the
  means of these Fairies; and many such have been taken away by the said
  spirits for a fortnight or a month together, being carried with them in
  chariots through the air, over hills and dales, rocks and precipices,
  till at last they have been found lying in some meadow or mountain,
  bereaved of their senses and commonly one of their members to boot.</p>

  <p>Book III, chap. xvi.</p>

  <p>It may not be omitted that certain wicked women ... being seduced by
  the illusion of devils, believe and profess <!-- Page 135 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135"></a>[135]</span> that in the
  night-times they ride abroad with Diana, the goddess of the Pagans, or
  else with Herodias, with an innumerable multitude, upon certain beasts,
  and pass over many countries and nations in the silence of the night, and
  do whatsoever those fairies or ladies command.</p>

  <p>Book IV, chap. x.</p>

  <p>Indeed your grandam's maids were wont to set a bowl of milk before him
  and his cousin, Robin Goodfellow, for grinding of malt or mustard, and
  sweeping the house at midnight; and you have also heard that he would
  chafe exceedingly, if the maid or goodwife of the house, having
  compassion of his nakedness, laid any clothes for him, besides his mess
  of white bread and milk which was his standing fee. For in that case he
  saith: What have we here? Hemton hamton<a name="Sco_1"></a><a
  href="#ScoN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, here will I never more tread nor
  stampen.</p>

  <p>Book V, chap. iii. "Of a man turned into an ass, and returned again
  into a man, by one of Bodin's witches: S. Augustine's opinion thereof."
  (See p. 30.)</p>

  <p>It happened in the city of Salamin in the kingdom of Cyprus, where
  there is a good haven, that a ship loaden with merchandise stayed there
  for a short space. In the meantime many of the soldiers and mariners went
  to shore, to provide fresh victuals; among which number a certain
  Englishman, being a sturdy young fellow, went to a woman's house, a
  little way out of the city, and not far from the sea-side, to <!-- Page
  136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136"></a>[136]</span> see
  whether she had any eggs to sell. Who, perceiving him to be a lusty young
  fellow, a stranger, and far from his country (so as, upon the loss of
  him, there would be the less miss or enquiry), she considered with
  herself how to destroy him; and willed him to stay there awhile, whilst
  she went to fetch a few eggs for him. But she tarried long, so as the
  young man called unto her desiring her to make haste; for he told her
  that the tide would be spent, and by that means his ship would be gone,
  and leave him behind. Howbeit, after some detracting of time, she brought
  him a few eggs, willing him to return to her, if his ship were gone when
  he came.</p>

  <p>The young fellow returned towards his ship, but before he went aboard,
  he would needs eat an egg or twain to satisfy his hunger; and within
  short space he became dumb and out of his wits, as he afterwards said.
  When he would have entered into the ship, the mariners beat him back with
  a cudgel, saying, "What a murrain lacks the ass? Whither the devil will
  this ass?" The ass, or young man&mdash;I cannot tell by which name I
  should term him&mdash;being many times repelled, and understanding their
  words that called him ass, considering that he could speak never a word
  and yet could understand everybody, he thought that he was bewitched by
  the woman at whose house he was. And therefore, when by no means he could
  get into the boat, but was driven to tarry and see her departure, being
  also beaten from place to place as an ass, he remembered the witch's <!--
  Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
  words, and the words of his own fellows that called him ass, and returned
  to the witch's house; in whose service he remained by the space of three
  years, doing nothing with his hands all that while, but carried such
  burthens as she laid on his back; having only this comfort, that,
  although he were reputed an ass among strangers and beasts, yet that both
  this witch and all other witches knew him to be a man.</p>

  <p>After three years were passed over, in a morning betimes he went to
  town before his dame, who upon some occasion ... stayed a little behind.
  In the meantime being near to a church, he heard a little sacring-bell
  ring to the elevation of a morrow mass; and not daring to go into the
  church, lest he should have been beaten and driven out with cudgels, in
  great devotion he fell down in the churchyard upon the knees of his
  hinder legs, and did lift his forefeet over his head, as the priest doth
  hold the sacrament at the elevation. Which prodigious sight when certain
  merchants of Genoa espied, and with wonder beheld, anon cometh the witch
  with a cudgel in her hand, beating forth the ass. And because, as it hath
  been said, such kinds of witchcrafts are very usual in those parts, the
  merchants aforesaid made such means as both the ass and the witch were
  attached by the judge. And she, being examined and set upon the rack,
  confessed the whole matter, and promised that if she might have liberty
  to go home, she would restore him to his old shape; and being dismissed
  she did accordingly. So as notwithstanding they apprehended her again,
  and burned her; and the <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_138"></a>[138]</span> young man returned into his country with
  a joyful and merry heart.</p>

  <p>Book VII, chap. ii.</p>

  <p>"Know you this by the way, that heretofore Robin Goodfellow and
  Hobgoblin were as terrible, and also as credible to the people, as hags
  and witches be now: and in time to come a witch will be as much derided
  and contemned, and as plainly perceived, as the illusion and knavery of
  Robin Goodfellow. And in truth, they that maintain walking spirits with
  their transformation, &amp;c, have no reason to deny Robin Goodfellow,
  upon whom there hath gone as many and as credible tales as upon witches;
  saving that it hath not pleased the translators of the Bible to call
  spirits by the name of Robin Goodfellow, as they have termed diviners,
  soothsayers, poisoners, and cozeners by the name of witches."</p>

  <p>Book VII, chap. xv.</p>

  <p>"But certainly some one knave in a white sheet hath cozened and abused
  many thousands that way; specially when Robin Goodfellow kept such a coil
  in the country.... They [our mothers' maids] have so fraid us with
  bull-beggars, spirits, witches, urchins, elves, hags, fairies, satyrs,
  pans, fauns, sylens, Kit with the canstick<a name="Sco_2"></a><a
  href="#ScoN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, tritons, centaurs, dwarfs, giants,
  imps, calkers, conjurors, nymphs, changelings, Incubus, Robin Goodfellow,
  the spoorn, the mare, the man in the oak, the hell-wain, the fire-drake,
  the puckle, Tom Thumb, hobgoblin, <!-- Page 139 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139"></a>[139]</span> Tom tumbler,
  boneless, and other such beings, that we are afraid of our own
  shadows."</p>

  <p>Book XIII, chap. xix. [To set an horse's or an ass's head on a man's
  neck and shoulders.] (See p. 30.)</p>

  <p>The words used in such case are uncertain, and to be recited at the
  pleasure of the witch or cozener. But at the conclusion of this, cut off
  the head of a horse or an ass (before they be dead, otherwise the virtue
  or strength thereof will be the less effectual), and make an earthen
  vessel of fit capacity to contain the same, and let it be filled with the
  oil and fat thereof, cover it close, and daub it over with loam; let it
  boil over a soft fire three days continually, that the flesh boiled may
  run into oil, so as the bare bones may be seen; beat the hair into
  powder, and mingle the same with the oil; and anoint the heads of the
  standers by, and they shall seem to have horses' or asses' heads.</p>

  <p>Discourse upon Devils and Spirits, chap. xi.</p>

  <p>"The Rabbins and, namely, Rabbi Abraham, writing upon the second of
  Genesis, do say that God made the fairies, bugs, Incubus, Robin
  Goodfellow, and other familiar or domestic spirits and devils on the
  Friday; and being prevented with the evening of the Sabbath, finished
  them not, but left them unperfect; and that therefore, that ever since
  they use to fly the holiness of the Sabbath, seeking dark holes in
  mountains and woods, wherein they hide themselves till the <!-- Page 140
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140"></a>[140]</span> end of the
  Sabbath, and then come abroad to trouble and molest men."</p>

  <p>Discourse, &amp;c., chap. xxi.</p>

  <p>"<i>Virunculi terrei</i> are such as was Robin Goodfellow, that would
  supply the office of servants&mdash;specially of maids: as to make a fire
  in the morning, sweep the house, grind mustard and malt, draw water,
  &amp;c.; these also rumble in houses, draw latches, go up and down
  stairs, &amp;c.... There go as many tales upon this Hudgin<a
  name="Sco_3"></a><a href="#ScoN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> in some parts of
  Germany, as there did in England of Robin Goodfellow."</p>

  <p>See pp. <a href="#Page_39">39</a>, <a href="#Page_63">63</a>. The text
  here given is that of the reprint of the 1628 edition, edited for the
  Percy Society by J. Payne Collier in 1841. The original black-letter
  tract, there described as being "in the library of Lord Francis Egerton,
  M.P.," is still in that collection, which is now known as the Bridgewater
  House Library. Collier's introduction is characteristic; it contains a
  good deal of correct information, and an interesting note based on
  forgeries of his own in Henslowe's <i>Diary</i>.</p>

  opprobriously tying fish-tails to their backsides; in revenge whereof an

  <i>Reliques</i> from <i>The Mysteries of Love and Eloquence</i>, a
  curious book of which the preface is signed E.P.; the British Museum
  Catalogue attributes these initials to Edward Phillips, the nephew of
  John Milton. But Rimbault pointed out that this song occurs in a tract of
  1635, <i>A Description of the King and Queen of the Fairies</i>,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
